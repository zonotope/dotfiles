<p><a href="http://www.rethinkrobotics.com">Rethink Robotics</a>, the Boston, Mass.-based maker of collaborative robots Baxter and Sawyer, shut its doors today. Rethink was founded in 2008 and raised nearly $150 million to date, according to Crunchbase. Its last round of funding was an $18 million Series E in August 2017.</p>
<p>Rethink Robotics CEO Scott Eckert confirmed the news via email to <em>The Robot Report</em>.</p>
<p>“I can confirm that unfortunately the news is true, Rethink Robotics closed its doors today,” Eckert writes. “We were pioneers and innovators in the industry and responsible for the creation of the collaborative robot category, but unfortunately we didn’t quite achieve the market success we had intended.  We have been helping our team find new homes and have been overwhelmed with interest.  It’s a world-class group of people will continue to do great things in their next endeavors.”</p>
<p>But this is tough news for robotics community, of course. Rethink, which was founded in 2008, has been an important part of growing the collaborative robotics market. Founded by Rodney Brooks and Ann Whitaker, Rethink Robotics sold the cobot concept so thoroughly that it’s now an important, growing segment of the robotics industry.</p>
<p>We last heard from Rethink Robotics, which was once known as Heartland Robotics, in July 2018 when it announced it was <a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/rethink-robotics-continues-growth-with-new-global-distribution-partners/">adding seven distributors</a> throughout the United States, Europe, and Asia-Pacific. Unfortunately, those distributors didn’t have much time to sell the Rethink concept.</p>
<p>This story is developing and will be updated if we learn more.</p>

        <div>
            <div>
<p> There's a big new feature for iPhone experts this year: It's <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/shortcuts/id915249334?mt=8" class="external">an app called Shortcuts</a>, and with a little bit of logic and know-how, you can stitch together several apps and create a script that can be activated by pressing a button or using Siri. </p>
<p> Some early uses are predictable, like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/shortcuts/comments/9kh2x8/instagram_story_highlights_download_photos_videos/" class="external"> saving Instagram photos</a>, sharing the song you're listening to, or creating a morning routine that activates your lights and plays a song. </p>
<p> But <a href="https://twitter.com/sonikku_a2" class="external">Robert Petersen of Arizona</a> has developed a more serious shortcut: It's called <a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/2d68cb1ee7b84f08ace2fd600b9855b5" class="external"> Police</a>, and it monitors police interactions so you have a record of what happened. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/2d68cb1ee7b84f08ace2fd600b9855b5" class="external"> Once the shortcut is installed</a>, you just have to say, "Hey Siri, I'm getting pulled over." Then the program pauses music you may be playing, turns down the brightness on the iPhone, and turns on "do not disturb" mode. </p>

<p> It also sends a quick text to a predetermined contact to tell them you've been pulled over, and it starts recording using the iPhone's front-facing camera. Once you've stopped recording, it can text or email the video to a different predetermined contact and save it to Dropbox. </p>
<p> "It seemed to me that if you're getting pulled over it couldn't hurt to have a recording of the incident," Petersen said in a direct message on Tuesday. "The police these days in many places have body cams, so this could be the civilian equivalent." </p>
<p> The idea of a hands-free mobile app for fraught interactions isn't new — since 2012, the American Civil Liberties Union and others have <a href="https://www.wired.com/2015/05/right-film-police-apps-can-help/" class="external">developed apps</a> to record and livestream encounters with the police. </p>
<p> While he didn't base the shortcut on existing apps, Petersen said he was inspired by projects by digital-rights groups like the Electronic Frontier Foundation. </p>
<p> It's difficult to tell how many people have downloaded the shortcut, but it's the third-most-popular post of all time on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/shortcuts/" class="external">burgeoning subreddit dedicated to sharing shortcut recipes</a>, and it's been <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/debug/record-police-siri-shortcut/" class="external">widely covered</a> in the Apple-enthusiast press. It's on version 1.4, and changes so far have focused on bug fixes and support for additional services, like iCloud Drive.                                                                                 </p>

<p> Petersen said that most responses he'd received since posting the shortcut in September had been positive and that some people had told him they want to adapt it to different potentially dangerous situations. </p>
<p> Some people "say they've had issues in the past with the police, and one woman planned on using the shortcut to help with a stalker issue she was having with an ex-boyfriend so that she could send her location to family quickly should anything occur," Petersen said. </p>
<p> "That's one of the great things about Shortcuts: Anyone can edit a shortcut someone else has made to suit their specific needs," he continued. </p>
<h2> You don't need to be a programmer to create your own shortcut </h2>
<p><span class="image-source-only"><span class="image-source">                                            Screenshot                                    </span></span>You can examine all the steps a shortcut takes and all the apps and services it uses — so you can be sure that the script isn't, say, uploading your data to a random server when you use a shortcut you didn't write. The entire recipe for the Police shortcut can be accessed in the Shortcuts app. </p>
<p> Petersen said he didn't have a background in programming but knew enough to get around and had written scripts for macOS in the past. He added that he was an Apple fan and was surprised that the company had introduced this kind of feature for power users given its tendency to keep things simple and locked down. </p>
<p> If you're interested in making your own shortcuts, Petersen has some advice. </p>
<p> "The platform has a lot of potential, and if you read the Apple user guides and consult with others on forums, or just look at how other people's shortcuts work and 'reverse engineer' them to your own needs, you can learn a lot quickly," he said. </p>
<p> You can <a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/2d68cb1ee7b84f08ace2fd600b9855b5" class="external"> download the Police shortcut here</a>. Make sure you have the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/shortcuts/id915249334?mt=8" class="external">Shortcuts app installed</a>. </p>

            <div><p class="Text_Inital-Cap-Text">T<span class="Optical-Kerning">hi</span>s year marks the thirtieth anniversary of the first publication in the Soviet Union of Vasily Grossman’s <span class="Ital">Life and Fate</span>, a nine-hundred-page novel of life under Stalin. This was a small posthumous triumph for the author. The <span class="Small-Caps">kgb</span> had confiscated the manuscript in 1961, and Grossman—who wrote to Khrushchev asking, “What is the point of me being physically free when the book I dedicated my life to is arrested?”—was told that it could not be published in the <span class="Small-Caps">ussr</span> for another two hundred years. Depressed and suffering from stomach cancer, he died in 1964.</p><p class="Text_Text">The censors knew what they were doing. Like Arthur Koestler’s <span class="Ital">Darkness at Noon</span>, <span class="Ital">Life and Fate</span> depicts Communism and Fascism as ideological mirror-images, two quarreling heads on one great monster. The manuscript made it out of the <span class="Small-Caps">ussr</span> on smuggled microfilm in the late 1970s, and appeared in English in Robert Chandler’s 1985 Harper &amp; Row translation (reissued by New York Review Books in 2006). Although the Soviet Union’s collapse was still a few years off, <span class="Ital">Life and Fate</span> is far too great to be quickly absorbed, and Grossman’s book was swept under in the wave of historical forgetfulness that followed the Cold War. Immediately after the collapse, Francis Fukuyama’s more-celebrated book descried <span class="Ital">The End of History</span>; ironically, its Hegelian presentation of liberal democracy as the culmination of the Universal History of mankind was a <span class="Ital">réchauffé</span> of the work of Alexandre Kojève, a Russian-born self-avowed Stalinist posthumously exposed in 1999 as a Soviet spy. Since then History has marched on, trampling memory underfoot. Chandler justly remarks that <span class="Ital">Life and Fate</span> is “the true <span class="Ital">War and Peace</span>” of the twentieth century, “the most complete portrait of Stalinist Russia we have or are ever likely to have.” Those who have read both books will agree that the comparison honors Tolstoy no less than Grossman. But most American readers still know next to nothing about Grossman’s masterwork.</p><p class="Text_Text"><span class="Ital">Life and Fate</span> is a massive literary fusion of poetry and mathematics, narrative and scientific observation. Multiple stories of struggle and suffering—a rich accumulation of significant data about the human condition in the age of ideology—are punctuated by Tolstoyan passages of philosophical reflection on the inner meaning of these imaginatively generated phenomena. The book centers on Hitler’s invasion of the <span class="Small-Caps">ussr</span> and the smashing of “two hammers . . . each composed of millions of tons of metal and flesh” at the Battle of Stalingrad, events whose shock waves the narrative registers with seismographic sensitivity as they disrupt and volatilize hundreds of interconnected lives across an entire continent.</p><p class="Text_Text">In one of the book’s first chapters, Grossman describes a firestorm unleashed by the Luftwaffe bombing of fuel tanks:</p><p class="Blockquote_Blockquote--First-">The life that had reigned hundreds of millions of years before, the terrible life of the primeval monsters, had broken out of its deep tombs; howling and roaring, stamping its huge feet, it was devouring everything round about. The fire rose thousands of feet, carrying with it clouds of vaporized oil that exploded into flame only high in the sky. The mass of flame was so vast that the surrounding whirlwind was unable to bring enough oxygen to the burning molecules of hydrocarbon; a black, swaying vault separated the starry sky of autumn from the burning earth. It was terrible to look up and see a black firmament streaming with oil.</p><p class="Blockquote_Blockquote--Last-">The columns of flame and smoke looked at one moment like living beings seized by horror and fury, at another moment like quivering poplars and aspens. Like women with long, streaming hair, the black clouds and red flames joined together in a wild dance.</p><p class="Text_Text-Flush">Only an eyewitness—Grossman reported from Stalingrad for the newspaper <span class="Ital">Red Star</span>—could provide such particular details. Only a great writer could compose such an intensely lyrical apocalypsis: Life, chemically transformed inside the earth into combustible matter, rages and consumes itself in a vast, murderous vortex. Tens of millions of souls haunt these flames, including Grossman’s mother, shot over a pit with the other Jews of Berdichev, Ukraine. Here is the deep mystery at the heart of <span class="Ital">Life and Fate</span>, and of our time: how the industrial lethality of totalitarianism gestated within, and broke free from, the soil and sediment of human life.</p><p class="Text_Text pullquote-left month-border">Quantum theory offers an illuminating analogy for this relationship, but from a strictly inorganic viewpoint.</p><p class="Text_Inital-Cap-Text">E<span class="Optical-Kerning">ar</span>ly in <span class="Ital">Life and Fate</span>, two Soviet commanders under fire seem to be on the verge of beginning “the one conversation that really mattered—about the meaning of Stalingrad.” That particular conversation fails to occur; the book as a whole is that conversation. It is a teeming and tumultuous literary cosmos, and at its center is the problem of the relationship between organic spontaneity and freedom (Life) and mechanical, ineluctable social forces (Fate).</p><p class="Text_Text">Quantum theory offers an illuminating analogy for this relationship, but from a strictly inorganic viewpoint. What an individual photon will do when it strikes a reflective surface cannot be predicted; it may go straight through the surface or bounce off it in any number of directions. In the aggregate, however, photons obey the laws of classical optics; governed by statistical probabilities, the path of light is for all practical purposes entirely predictable. The comparable predictability of human behavior on a large scale, “the principle of quantum politics,” forms the basis of a totalitarian physics. Probability theory underlies the mass social phenomena with which alone the State reckons, as well as the crude, ideological group-forms—Party, peasant, bourgeois; Russian, Ukrainian, Jew—it imposes on the concrete relations of irreducibly unique human beings.</p><p class="Text_Text">Physics in fact furnishes a rich fund of images in <span class="Ital">Life and Fate</span>. Viktor Shtrum, the book’s central character, struggles to work out the mathematics of the disintegration of atomic nuclei; Grossman’s narrative, densely populated with characters displaced by enormous acts of aggression, simultaneously records a kind of massive nuclear reaction. Like energized, destabilized atoms, individuals violently collide, clump together, split apart, and experience various degrees of psychological fission. A kindly German governess is denounced by a Russian neighbor who covets her room. A Jewish doctor in a Ukrainian town occupied by the Wehrmacht finds her door smashed and women arguing over her furniture. An old Bolshevik in the Gulag suffers a crisis of political faith when he hesitates to inform on criminals who filch a long nail from the camp tool shop and drive it through another inmate’s ear into his brain. A Jewish commissar is made to “frown, twitch, and turn away” on seeing the look of a Jewish airman he has publicly reprimanded for “nationalist prejudices” when he defends himself against anti-Semitism. A comrade of Trotsky’s learns in the Lubyanka prison “how a man could be split apart” by the State he had helped to found. A pitiless Party secretary is “overwhelmed by a helpless tenderness, an unreasoning love” on taking leave of his wife and children; “their life, which had seemed one, had suddenly split apart.” The particulars are all unique, but the same basic phenomena of behavior and feeling—the observable patterns of a social and psychological physics—recur repeatedly throughout the book.</p><p class="Text_Inital-Cap-Text">R<span class="Optical-Kerning">ea</span>ders will pause to reflect on a strange remark that turns out to be located at the mathematical center of <span class="Ital">Life and Fate</span> as reckoned by parts and chapters. On his way to Berlin to report on the construction of a gas chamber and ovens, the <span class="Reduced-Text-Body">SS</span> Commandant Liss recalls Mostovskoy, a Bolshevik prisoner he had tried to convince of the essential identity of Hitlerism and Stalinism: “What an interesting old man! Yes, once you get inside the nucleus of the atom, the forces of attraction begin to act on you as powerfully as the centrifugal forces.” It is no coincidence that the core of Grossman’s narrative is a zone of intense industrial negativity. For the totalitarian State is something like an extremely heavy metal, and its nucleus—the point where all ideological, technological, and administrative forces converge and achieve maximum concentration—is a death camp.</p><p class="Text_Text">It is not for nothing that Liss calls Mostovskoy “Teacher.” Hitler’s vast concentrationary universe—42,500 ghettos and camps had been identified as of 2013—plagiarizes the Gulag, the prison archipelago begun by Lenin and finished by Stalin. Liss’s gas chamber/crematory complex is designed by a Professor Stahlgang (Steel Corridor), an echo of Stalin (Man of Steel) and of the trains and railways that incessantly fed the camps of Poland and Siberia. In the Nazi camps, the exhausted slaves that Primo Levi describes as “empty inside . . . like the slough of certain insects one finds on the banks of swamps” were called <span class="Ital">Muselmänner</span>. In the Soviet ones they were called <span class="Ital">dokhodyagi</span>, a term derived from <span class="Ital">dokhodit</span>, “to reach” or “to attain”: these extinguished souls had at last come to the end of the road of socialism. But Hitler’s trains went further, to the very last stop on the line. While the Gulag’s millions died of exposure, starvation, and overwork on the frozen tundra, the Germans of the Third Reich, “a people moved by the most progressive of philosophies,” addressed the problem of the enemies of the State with real entrepreneurial innovation. Stahlgang’s streamlined factory is built to fulfill all production quotas, “transforming life itself, and all forms of energy pertaining to it, into inorganic matter” through a process that combined the principles of “the ordinary industrial hydro-turbine . . . with those of the slaughter-house and the garbage incineration unit.”</p><p class="Text_Text">This is not all. For the Annihilation Camp at the center of <span class="Ital">Life and Fate</span> (the operational abstraction of the word <span class="Ital">Vernichtungslager</span> is stunning) is the scene of a perverse Last Supper, a ghastly photographic negative of the biblical original:</p><p class="Blockquote_Blockquote--First-">A small surprise had been laid for Eichmann and Liss during their tour of inspection. In the middle of the gas chamber, the engineers had laid a small table with hors d’oeuvres and wine. Reineke invited Eichmann and Liss to sit down.</p><p class="Blockquote_Blockquote--Middle-">Eichmann laughed at this charming idea and said: “With the greatest of pleasure.” . . .</p><p class="Blockquote_Blockquote--Last-">“Well, gentlemen,” said Eichmann, “I call that excellent ham!”</p><p class="Text_Text-Flush">Adolf Eichmann’s little Jewish joke is more than a demonic obscenity. Jesus agrees with the Hebrew God who calls himself <span class="Ital">El Shaddai</span>, “God of Breasts”: man does not live by bread alone. The biblical God nourishes soul and body alike—literally, in the case of the communion wafer. Totalitarianism reverses this relationship. Like some primitive, malformed Titan, the State, Nietzsche’s “coldest of all cold monsters,” feeds on human lives.</p><p class="Text_Inital-Cap-Text">M<span class="Optical-Kerning">as</span>s murder and cannibalism are intimately connected in the history of the <span class="Small-Caps">ussr</span> and the Third Reich. Stalin used famine as a targeted political weapon, killing roughly five million Ukrainians in the Holodomor of 1932–33; some victims resorted to anthropophagy. Nor is Eichmann’s gas-chamber meal a farfetched invention. Ukrainian witnesses interviewed by Father Patrick Desbois in <span class="Ital">The Holocaust by Bullets</span> repeatedly testified that the men of the <span class="Ital">Einsatzgruppen</span> banqueted next to the pits where Jews were being shot. Desbois also learned from a Polish peasant in Belzec that the <span class="Reduced-Text-Body">SS</span> requisitioned farm machinery used to separate husks from grains. Enslaved Jews had to turn the handles of the machines, not to sort wheat or barley, but to ventilate the ashes of their cremated fellows.</p><p class="Text_Text">Images of ravenous, grinding machines and fierce, voracious beasts are woven throughout <span class="Ital">Life and Fate</span>, sometimes in subtle ways. Soviet soldiers wait at Stalingrad “to be eaten,” chewed up by “the iron teeth of the German offensive.” Flames “flickered like tongues from the mouths of mortars.” Liss’s gas chamber seems to have “broken free of its creators . . . feeling its own concrete hunger, secreting toxins, masticating with its steel jaws, beginning the long process of digestion.” David, a Jewish boy caught in the Nazi dragnet, recalls a picture book in which a wolf’s “green eyes” and “red jaw” are just visible in a dark forest near a clearing where a small goat grazes. Viktor refers to <span class="Ital">Max und Moritz</span>, Wilhelm Busch’s classic illustrated children’s book about naughty boys who are ground into pellets by a farmer and eaten by ducks: human grist for the mill. And a letter to Viktor from his mother, Anna Semyonovna, smuggled out of a Ukrainian ghetto, mentions Alphonse Daudet’s “Les Vieux.” The reader who turns to Daudet’s story finds in it many funny and poignant things, including an orphan haltingly mouthing a passage in which the Church Father Irenaeus cries out “ ‘I am the wheat of the Lord; I must be ground between the teeth of animals.’ . . . Just then two lions jumped on him and devoured him.”</p><p class="Text_Text">In fact, something like the wheat of the Lord—individual goodness that nourishes the soul even as the body is being ground to “labor-camp dust”—turns out to be the eccentric, living antipode in <span class="Ital">Life and Fate</span> of the dense gravitational mass of the State. This deep moral truth is brought home by Ikonnikov, a camp inmate who lost faith in Stalin—and then in God—after he witnessed the horrors of collectivization and the execution of twenty thousand Jews. In a written testament that Liss and Mostovskoy regard with contempt, Ikonnikov offers an organic characterization of the process described in the analogy of quantum politics. The world is ruled by abstract concepts of universal Good, capable of producing “greater evil than evil itself.” These strange historical outgrowths are the husks of a discarded human vitality, as inevitable, in Ikonnikov’s view, as the accretion of Christian orthodoxy around the living example of Jesus. Yet kernels of individual goodness and freedom, “hiding in the living darkness of the human heart,” are “scattered throughout life like atoms of radium.” These living kernels, undetectable by political calculations, sprout senseless acts of kindness “outside any system of social or religious good.”</p><p class="Text_Text pullquote-center month-border pullquote-left"><span class="Ital">Life and Fate</span> bears out Ikonnikov’s insight.</p><p class="Text_Text"><span class="Ital">Life and Fate</span> bears out Ikonnikov’s insight. Anna Semyonovna knows what awaits the Jews, but continues to tutor pupils in French and to treat patients for glaucoma and cataracts. She writes from the ghetto that “it’s not so much me visiting the sick as the other way round—that the people are a kind doctor who is healing my soul.” The Soviet soldier and physician Sofya Levinton, “fighting against some powerful force that she found repugnant,” remains silent when the <span class="Reduced-Text-Body">SS</span> calls for doctors and surgeons. With a “feeling of exaltation,” she chooses to die with David, whom she has been feeding and caring for since they were imprisoned in a goods wagon. She is a virgin, but her last living thought as she clings to the boy in the gas chamber testifies to the inner generativity of love: “I’ve become a mother.” Grekov, a captain in an outpost surrounded by Germans, saves the life of Krymov, a commissar who intends to have him shot for anti-Soviet attitudes. “There’s something good in your eyes,” Grekov tells Krymov. “But you’ve suffered a lot.” These private acts of kindness are in one sense entirely futile: all of these men and women are doomed. Yet Ikonnikov, who condemns himself to death when he refuses to help build extermination facilities, maintains that “dumb, blind love,” as “powerless as dew” before Fate, is nothing less than “man’s meaning.”</p><p class="Text_Inital-Cap-Text">P<span class="Optical-Kerning">eo</span>ple everywhere in <span class="Ital">Life and Fate</span> are fed into a steel hopper of tremendous social forces. The State is unconcerned with whether any particular individual resists or cooperates with these forces; all are in any case effectively governed. That is the fundamental truth of totalitarian physics. But there is deeper truth: the moral truth of freedom, of the “inflammable peat” of the soul. In Grossman’s book, the encounter of existing individuals and unalterable circumstances, of freedom and necessity, ultimately reveals itself to be a process of moral threshing. And no writer observes and registers this process more perspicuously than he.</p><p class="Text_Text">At Stalingrad, a Soviet artillery barrage blasts soil into the air; “these clouds of earth then passed through the sieve of gravity, the heavier lumps falling straight to the ground, the dust rising into the sky.” Gravity separates totally disintegrated matter from clumps of earth that retain mass and density in spite of the explosion; the atomized particles are sucked up by “the cruel sky, the sky of ice and fire”—an image of the pitiless abstraction of the State—while the clods are drawn toward the earth. Here is how a former Chekist describes an Arctic construction project that cost the lives of ten thousand prisoners:</p><p class="Blockquote_Blockquote">You should have seen the columns of zeks marching to work. In dead silence. The blue and green of the Northern Lights above them, ice and snow all round them, and the roar of the dark ocean. There’s power for you.</p><p class="Text_Text">In Grossman’s anthropomorphic and almost pantheistic vision, even plants and animals are disturbed and afflicted by the “terrible frozen abyss” that hangs overhead. Trees at a northern airfield shake in the night, “frightened by a bad dream.” Spruce and birch saplings, cut off from the sun by the forest canopy, freeze to death “in the twilight of penal servitude.” Soldiers tell of dogs who ignore Russian aircraft but run at the sound of German ones, and of flocks of starlings that perfectly mimic the whistle of bullets. A cat is scalded after its owner is arrested; another, a thin stray with “weepy eyes” that David feeds from a tin, is disposed of by a neighbor who finds it disgusting. But other animals share a precious measure of warmth with human beings. A kitten, “half-paralyzed” by artillery fire, drags itself from a pile of rags so that it may die near kind Katya, the radio operator. Novikov, a battle-hardened tank corps commander, keeps a chipmunk and a hedgehog in his quarters, and David treasures a cocoon in a matchbox, releasing the chrysalis that emerges from it right before he is sucked into the gas chamber. Simple kindness draws rich human grain toward the life-giving earth, separating it from the empty husks that ride the frozen wind.</p><p class="Text_Text">The hard reality of combat also separates wheat from chaff in <span class="Ital">Life and Fate</span>. Operation Barbarossa mobilized the largest invading force in history (one hundred and fifty divisions of four million Axis soldiers), and culminated in the greatest and most terrible battle ever fought. Nowhere was the uselessness of the State, of commissars, security officials, and Party bureaucrats, more evident than at Stalingrad. The inexperienced Nyeudobnov is given a generalship only because of his status in the Party and the <span class="Small-Caps">nkvd</span>. Left briefly in command by Novikov (whom he actually outranks), he realizes with horror that “here at the front, the terrible rage of the State, before which millions of people bowed down and trembled, was of no effect”; were the Germans to appear, “it would be no good threatening to dismiss them from their posts or accusing them of conspiring with enemies of the people.” Stalingrad was a socio-physical experiment in which an enormous quantity of ideological and administrative mass simply evaporated; formerly a “million tons of granite,” the State at the moment of crisis weighed less than a desiccated leaf.</p><p class="Text_Inital-Cap-Text">“T<span class="Optical-Kerning">he</span> soul of wartime Stalingrad was freedom,” Grossman writes. We see this freedom in the soldiers’ open mockery of Krymov, assigned to a surrounded outpost so that he may deliver ideological indoctrination to the besieged combatants and write reports about them. (The certainty of being turned to dust by German steel must have had a liberating effect on them.) We see it most of all in the incalculable power of spontaneously united individuals:</p><p class="Blockquote_Blockquote--First-">For all the vast forces involved, the German attacks had still not led to a decisive victory. Some of the Russian regiments now only numbered a few dozen soldiers; it was these few men, bearing all the weight of the terrible fighting, who confused the calculations of the Germans.</p><p class="Blockquote_Blockquote--Last-">The Germans were simply unable to believe that all their attacks were being borne by a handful of men. They thought the Soviet reserves were being brought up in order to reinforce the defence.</p><p class="Text_Text-Flush">Because the Germans erroneously assumed that the reserves had already been deployed, they were entirely unprepared for the lightning-fast encirclement they suffered in the final Soviet offensive. The “true strategists” of the offensive were not generals, but scouts, sappers, plotters, gunners, and snipers: free patriots “with their backs to the Volga who fought off Paulus’s divisions.” Victory was achieved not by a State collective abstractly conceived and imposed from above, but—for once!—by a true social collective, an organic brotherhood of workers. It was achieved by the Soviet people.</p><p class="Text_Text">But freedom—Life—is only one part of the meaning of Stalingrad. Hegel saw the cunning of Reason even in the Terror of the French Revolution, the paradigm of all modern ideological revolutions; History’s abandonment and sacrifice of vast multitudes of individuals and peoples was in fact a necessary means of universal advancement, a hard husk that protected the idea of freedom until it was ready to sprout into the living actuality of human existence. Stalingrad fits this picture only partially. The Soviet victory meant that the peoples of Nazi-occupied Europe would be liberated from ideological tyranny. Yet the final defeat of Hitler cut off only one of the monster’s two heads—and anyway, both grow back. Stalingrad also saved Stalin, which meant that the peoples of Eastern Europe and the northern half of the Korean peninsula would be shoveled into the maw of Communism. And it fed an ugly Russian nationalism that picked out fresh targets of State oppression, including Tartars and Jews—the very people Vladimir Putin blamed for alleged interference in the 2016 election, dismissing them as “not even Russian . . . just with Russian passports.” The meaning of Stalingrad was in these respects a grotesque reversal of Hegel:</p><p class="Blockquote_Blockquote">The remorseless cunning of History, however, lay still more deeply hidden. Freedom engendered the Russian victory. Freedom was the apparent aim of the war. But the sly fingers of History changed this: freedom became simply a way of waging the war, a means to an end.</p><p class="Text_Initial-Cap-Text--No---">I<span class="Optical-Kerning">n </span><span class="Ital">Life and Fate</span>, the atomic State undergoes a kind of fission. The sheaf splits open; golden kernels spill out and sprout in ruined buildings and bomb craters. Three Soviet generals sit together in silence after the great battle ends, feeling “only human feelings”; these few minutes of silence—of happiness and sadness, love and humility—are “the finest of their lives.” In exile in Kazan, a city on the Volga, Viktor engages in intense conversations about politics and literature with a Muslim translator of Dante and Homer and a historian who speaks with the fearless “logic of truth.” Refreshed by the exhilaration and terror of speaking his mind, Viktor suddenly achieves a theoretical breakthrough, the most important scientific discovery of his life. His theory of atomic decay, which arises in “absolute freedom” from “the free play of thought,” is “bread, bread, black bread” for the soul.</p><p class="Text_Text">But these communities of freedom and goodness are as ephemeral as any fleeting isotope produced in a nuclear reaction. When Viktor returns to Moscow, he is persecuted by detractors who regard his theoretical work as an anti-Soviet piece of “Talmudic abstraction,” and his Jewish laboratory assistants are fired. In Stalingrad, the victorious State’s cannibalization of the victorious people commences while the guns are still hot. Colonel Novikov keeps Stalin waiting for eight minutes past the time he was to launch his tanks in the final Soviet offensive; exercising “the right to think twice before you send men to their death,” he delays so that the artillery will have time to clear out some enemy batteries. The attack succeeds without the loss of a single tank, and he is heartily and sincerely congratulated by General Nyeudobnov and Commissar Getmanov. That night, Getmanov asks Nyeudobnov to review his report denouncing Novikov for delaying, “at the start of a crucial operation, the operation to decide the outcome of the Great Patriotic War.” The steel City of Stalin rises anew on the ground of freedom: “Here, ten years later, was constructed a vast dam, one of the largest hydro-electric power stations in the world—the product of the forced labor of thousands of prisoners.”</p><p class="Text_Text">Strangely, Novikov has his first good sleep in weeks the night after he receives the dreaded summons from Moscow. Viktor’s experience is equally strange. A phone call from Stalin saves him from persecution and catapults him into a position of great privilege. But while he had previously “been full of thoughts about life, truth and freedom, about God,” he now teems with “petty anxieties, trivial irritations and thoughts that were emptier than the husks of sunflower seeds.” And when, “unable to refuse candies and cookies,” he sacrifices his inner freedom by signing his name to a letter denouncing two doctors on trumped-up charges of poisoning Maxim Gorky (Grossman signed a similar letter in 1952, when Jewish doctors were accused of plotting to murder Stalin), he realizes that “Everything in the world was insignificant compared to what he had lost. Everything in the world is insignificant compared to the truth and purity of one small man—even the empire stretching from the Black Sea to the Pacific Ocean, even science itself.”</p><p class="Text_Inital-Cap-Text">V<span class="Optical-Kerning">as</span>ily Grossman came to know History as more than a philosophical concept. It stormed through his homeland, seizing people by the millions and crushing them underfoot, and he smelled its foul breath in the stench of corpses. That experience brought home a fundamental truth that our willfully abstract and increasingly ideological age seems hell-bent on forgetting:</p><p class="Blockquote_Blockquote">Human groupings have one main purpose: to assert everyone’s right to be different, to be special, to think, feel and live in his or her own way. People join together in order to win or defend this right. But this is where a terrible, fateful error is born: the belief that these groupings in the name of a race, a God, a party or a State are the very purpose of life and not simply a means to an end. No! The only true and lasting meaning of the struggle for life lies in the individual, in his modest peculiarities and in his right to these peculiarities.</p><p class="Text_Text">One passage in <span class="Ital">Life and Fate</span> is eerily prescient. Grossman imagines a “machine of future ages and millennia” capable of recreating the whole range of human emotions and thoughts: “But the surface of the whole earth will be too small to accommodate this machine—this machine whose dimensions and weight will continually increase as it attempts to reproduce the peculiarities of mind and soul of an average, inconspicuous human being.” This is a prophetic warning for our age of big data and digital surveillance, an age in which the once-vital liberal democracies of the West find themselves littered with hollow institutions surrounded by thick administrative husks.</p><p class="Text_Text">The struggle of Life and Fate in the twenty-first century will determine whether Grossman’s waking nightmare will come to pass.</p><div class="article-author-bio"><p><b>Jacob Howland</b>’s writing includes<i> Glaucon’s Fate: History, Myth, and Character in Plato’s Republic</i>, forthcoming from Paul Dry Books.</p></div><p class="article-footnote"><small>This article originally appeared in The New Criterion, Volume 37 Number 2, on page 13<br />Copyright © 2017 The New Criterion | www.newcriterion.com <br /><a href="/issues/2018/10/totalitarian-physics-moral-threshing" title="newcriterion.com/issues/2018/10/totalitarian-physics-moral-threshing"> newcriterion.com/issues/2018/10/totalitarian-physics-moral-threshing </a></small></p></div>

The company is seeing crazy growth but they are still doing things like pushing directly to master and using prod deploys to test things out. I was hired to help improve this and implement things like staging environments, autoscaling of resources, and other DevOpsy stuff.<p>Since joining I've received considerable pushback on my ideas. Obviously I am the new guy and don't expect to just dictate people around nor is that my intention. However what really gets me is that the founder just straight up does not seem to trust me. Every suggestion I give - even things as industry standard such as the use of a staging environment - is met with suspicion and doubt and the insistence that I hadn't done enough proper "research" on the idea. I find this highly offensive considering I've been working in DevOps for almost seven years and before that was a SysAdmin.</p><p>So after two weeks, I got the approval to create a staging branch. I wrote up a huge document on the staging workflow, covering edge cases such as hotfixes and rollbacks. I put time on people's calendars and walked them through it including the founder. Yet he still continues to resist the change and pushes directly to master, ignores the new processes I put in place, and generally just does what he wants. He also keeps harping that I need to "earn his trust." I find this baffling - I mean, I was hired for a reason right? Why would they hire me if they didn't trust me?</p><p>I am starting to get frustrated, especially since the founder has pushed breaking changes directly to master and then I got flack since I am now the "systems" guy and am responsible for the health of the app. I'm trying to think of the best way to approach this diplomatically.

        </div>
    <p class="bb-p"><span class="bb-dropcap bb-dropcap--letter">T</span>here’s a mine, deep underground in Canada, that’s unlike any other. Just outside of Sudbury, Ontario, in a forest where curious bears frequently forage for raspberries in backyards, Creighton Mine workers in blue hard hats extract nickel from deep below the ground. But when they enter the half-open, jittery pitch-black lift to descend into the spacious cavern, they share the ride with a bunch of other hard-hatted folks. Their hats are orange though, and they are mining for something completely different: nothing.</p><p class="bb-p">That is, nothing so far. The fellow miners are actually physicists working at a massive, subterranean lab dubbed SNOLAB. It’s located at a depth of two kilometres – so deep you could easily stack four and a half Empire State buildings into this hole, one on top of the other. SNOLAB detectors scour the cosmos for the elusive stuff thought to make up the bulk of matter in our universe: dark matter. It’s an almighty, and thus far unfruitful, search. </p><p class="bb-p">So far, we have been able to detect <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/astronomers-have-found-the-universes-missing-matter/" class="bb-a">only a measly five per cent of all matter in the universe</a>; this atomic matter makes up all the galaxies and stars, planets, black holes, quasars, pulsars, neutrinos – as well as humans and all other life on Earth. The rest is unknown stuff, dark matter (25 per cent) and even the more enigmatic dark energy (70 per cent). We can observe dark matter’s gravitational effects on stars and galaxies but can’t seem to net its “dark” particles with any of our instruments. And boy have we tried.</p><p class="bb-p">Why are we trying to catch it? Sure, we won't be able to make the next generation cosmic smartphones out of dark matter. Nor will we be able to turn it into gold. But observing it will help us understand how galaxies actually hold together without flying apart – which they should do with the amount of atomic matter we are able to detect. After all, our own galaxy, the Milky Way, is thought to live in a vast cloud of dark matter – the so-called dark matter halo. </p><p class="bb-p">Finding dark matter will also help explain why we observe objects in deep space said to be optical illusions – when images of galaxies we get with telescopes have strange arcs and rings of light around them. Researchers say they are optical copies of the real galaxy laying behind a huge clump of dark matter that acts like a giant gravitational lens, bending the light from the galaxy and thus distorting and magnifying the image. This is called gravitational lensing. </p><p class="bb-p">Or, to put it more simply, scientists are searching for dark matter because they want to scratch an almighty itch. “It’s that itch you get when you’re laying awake at night and you get hit with this sudden thought of, ‘What does this all even mean?’” says Daniel Coderre, an experimental physicist at the University of Freiburg in Germany.</p><div class="bb-figure__wrapper">

    <p class="bb-p"><span class="bb-dropcap bb-dropcap--letter">A</span>s Joe Walding, a physicist at Royal Holloway, University of London who often works at SNOLAB, enters the two-storey lift, he smiles broadly. The journey down takes about six minutes, and it’s not for the faint-hearted: the lift doesn’t have any lights, and the darkness is almost palpable; its top is half-open, and it shakes and bangs so much on the way down that people sometimes faint. “You certainly shouldn’t stick your arm out or it’ll get cut off,” says Walding, half-jokingly. </p><p class="bb-p">He’s in a good mood – like many other physicists here these days: in May, the scientists at SNOLAB got exciting news. The lab, operating since 2011, has just received funding approval from the US Department of Energy to build a brand-new dark matter experiment, scheduled to start operating in 2020. Mightier than any other (and there are many), the uber-sensitive SuperCDMS will cost some $34 million – and will be tasked with finally spotting what no other detector has spotted yet; no pressure. </p><p>Despite huge pots of money being poured since the 1970s into dark matter experiments on, under or above Earth, despite endless late nights spent doing calculations, and despite plenty of media coverage, researchers keep getting nowhere. Apart from SNOLAB, there is the LUX experiment in Lead, South Dakota, one mile underground in an abandoned gold mine. It has obtained zero results. In France, the EDELWEISS experiment in a lab under the French Alps, under 1.7 km of rock, has found nothing. The PandaX experiment in the Jin-Ping sub-terrain laboratory in China hasn't spotted any particles either. In India, Jaduguda Underground Science Laboratory opened last year, 550 meters below the surface at an operating uranium mine. So far, they have found nothing (well, they've only been looking for a year). And on, and on, and on.</p><p class="bb-p">The leading theory is that dark matter is made out of particles that interact with normal, atomic, matter or light only through gravity - by exerting a gravitational pull. SuperCDMS will be looking for a very specific type of such exotic particles, so-called WIMPs, or weakly interacting massive particles. That’s the main (some say most obvious) dark matter candidate several detectors are searching for. Scientists are even trying to create these particles in the largest and most powerful particle accelerator in the world, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) near Geneva (which cost nearly $7 billion to build). But all in vain. </p><p class="bb-p">So just how much longer can researchers justify that they are looking for something unknown and finding nothing, but still get away with asking for more money to look for nothing... just a little bit longer? Well, turns out that for the researchers who have devoted their whole life to dark matter, null results are ultra-important – nearly as important as finding something.</p><p class="bb-p">“The only difference is that if you find dark matter, you get a Nobel Prize, but the importance in setting the limits [where there is no dark matter] is just the same,” says physicist Walter Fulgione from Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare (INFN) in Italy. That’s because setting tighter and tighter limits rules out hypotheses that seem viable, narrowing the window of search. After all, it took a century to detect gravitational waves, predicted by Albert Einstein in 1916, and nearly half a century to spot the Higgs boson in the LHC. Researchers knew what they were looking for and null results year after year helped them to better constrain their search limits. “The game is one about steady progress over years and decades, slowly chipping away at the possible range of models,” says Dan Hooper, an astrophysicist at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (FNAL) just outside Chicago.</p><p class="bb-p">Avi Loeb, a Harvard astronomer, describes science as “an island of knowledge surrounded by an ocean of ignorance”. If you search for a lion in the desert, you can find it eventually by excluding successively bigger regions of the desert in which you do not find the lion until you narrow the region to the footprint of the lion itself, he says. But this is true only if you know that a lion lives in the desert. Well, the good news is that the majority of researchers do agree that, like a lion in the desert, dark matter should be out there... somewhere.  </p>

    <p class="bb-p"><span class="bb-dropcap bb-dropcap--letter">A</span>s the lift reaches the bottom of the Creighton Mine, it first bounces up and down a few times before coming to a halt. To get to SNOLAB, researchers then have to navigate nearly two kilometres of dark, narrow tunnels, carefully dodging the nickel miners and their equipment. And it’s not just the miners that they have to be mindful of. The area around the mine – above ground, that is – is home to bears who sometimes wander in to say hello. Once, a researcher went out for a smoke, recalls Walding. Suddenly, he was face to face with three juvenile black bears that were stalking the scientists’ house next to the mine. A bear’s head appeared right next to his knee. “He had to have a big gin and tonic when he came back inside,” laughs Walding.</p><p class="bb-p">While the nickel mine has been around since the 1920s, the physics lab was only founded in 1992. The seemingly unusual location – deep underground – is not because of lack of space on the surface, but rather to shield sensitive detectors from energetic particles called cosmic rays. These are usually protons that come from faraway corners of the universe, and in the Earth’s atmosphere create a shower of other particles that rain down on us every second of every day. “We’re particularly worried about muons, which can interact with the matter surrounding our detectors and create neutrons, which can mimic a dark matter signal,” says Coderre. Thick slabs of rock can stop them in their tracks, though, helping scientists eliminate this interfering background noise.</p><p class="bb-p">While dark matter searches at SNOLAB (and elsewhere) have so far yielded nothing, the Creighton Mine did help one physicist, Art McDonald, get a Noble Prize in physics in 2015. That was for his work on neutrinos – ghostly, nearly massless particles that originate in the core of stars, in faraway cataclysmic events like supernovae, but can also be produced on Earth. Just like dark matter, they were theory once, first proposed in 1930; it took 26 years before the first neutrino was detected.</p><p class="bb-p">To accommodate SuperCDMS, the lab will be upgraded, to account for more electrical power, lighting and cooling. The apparatus will consist of a solid-state germanium and silicon detectors, cooled to extremely low temperatures of within a fraction of a degree above absolute zero. The capsule housing the detectors will be plunged into a water tank, with water also acting as shielding – to reduce the amount of background noise from the radioactivity of the mine. Many pieces of the experiment will be assembled and tested at surface facilities – famous physics laboratories like Fermilab, SLAC and PNNL – but the final assembly will be done underground at SNOLAB.</p><p class="bb-p">And what if SuperCDMS finds nothing? There are a couple of other experiments here at the mine such as DEAP-3600 that use a slightly different technology – namely, a nobel gas called argon to try and detect the WIMPs. That’s where Walding works, and those detectors will continue searching for WIMPs alongside the new experiment.</p><p class="bb-p">But for Coderre, null results provide important feedback about the theory – and help adjust it. “Finding nothing is obviously disappointing, but when searching for something completely new you sort of have to accept that as a likely outcome,” he says. “There is a correct answer to the dark matter problem that’s currently hidden to us and we’re doing all we can to find it.”</p><p class="bb-p">And that means attacking the problem on many fronts. Several experiments in former and current mines, under mountains and in space are searching for WIMPs – and it’s the steady progress over decades that counts, slowly chipping away at the possible range of dark matter models. “SuperCDMS will very likely make solid progress on this front,” says Hooper, adding that the detector will focus specifically on a new mass region for the WIMPs, which would assume that they are much lighter than what other detectors have been looking for. And just because other experiments have failed does not make the odds of SNOLAB’s future resident succeeding any smaller, he adds, narrowing the range of possible dark matter candidates.</p>












    <a href="/article/messaging-aliens-seti-meti" class="bb-card__link bb-card__link--article">The almighty tussle over whether we should talk to aliens or not</a>

    	
    <p class="bb-p"><span class="bb-dropcap bb-dropcap--letter">W</span>ith SuperCDMS still in the planning stage, spare a thought for the scientists who have been hunting for dark matter for many decades deep under the Italian Apennine Mountains, about an hour’s drive from Rome. Their dark matter detector is in a lab near the city of Aquila, which got ravaged by the 2009 earthquake (luckily, the lab wasn’t affected, but many physicists based in Aquila were). To get to the lab, the road takes you through a ten kilometre-long tunnel for about seven minutes, until you arrive deep below Gran Sasso, the highest peak. Turn off at a special exit, press a button, identify yourself in Italian over a speaker to the guard, and two huge metal double doors open to reveal a spacious cavern, the Gran Sasso National Laboratory – home to the most sensitive dark matter experiment in the world right now, XENON1T.</p><p class="bb-p">Founded in 1984, for the first two decades the researchers here were mainly studying neutrinos and cosmic rays. The dark matter hype caught on with the science crowd in mid-2000, and in 2002 the first detector – XENON10 – was switched on. It’s been getting upgrades ever since, morphing into XENON100, and now XENON1T, trying to catch the still hypothetical, but extremely rare interactions of WIMPs with ordinary matter.</p><p class="bb-p">The underground space is humongous. XENON1T is housed in one of three cavernous halls, each about 20 metres wide, 18 metres high and 100 metres long, all sporting their own experiments – 18 in total. They are designed for all kinds of science, from detecting solar neutrinos to study the inside of our Sun, to the biggest detector in the world that one day may catch the theoretical Majorana particle. About 950 researchers from 32 countries work in the lab.</p><p class="bb-p">In the dark matter hall, the most massive structure is a giant tank about 10m in diameter and 11m tall, resembling a large grain silo. It neighbours a three-storey glass building crammed with cryogenic pipes, pumps, coolers, subsystems and electronics, whose sole aim is to service the detector. The detector itself is inside the tank, sealed in a metre-thick stainless-steel cryostat. The detector and everything around is made of low-radioactivity materials, to reduce background ‘noise’ – just like at SNOLAB, radioactive materials emit electrons, gamma rays or neutrons that the detector is able to spot, messing up the picture of a potential arrival of a rare dark matter particle. To suppress any further unwanted background interactions, say from cosmic rays, the cryostat is immersed into about 700 tonnes of water in the outer tank. Some 1,400m of rock on top helps, too.</p><p class="bb-p">Inside the cryostat, the instrument is surrounded by two tonnes of ultra-cold liquified xenon gas (whereas the name of the experiment, slightly confusingly, is XENON1T – that’s because in the actual central core of the detector, the most sensitive part, there’s only one tonne of the liquified gas).  Xenon is not just colourless and odourless, it’s also one of the rarest elements on Earth. Mainly produced in Russia, South Africa and Saudi Arabia, it’s a by-product of the steel-making process, where liquid oxygen is used to get rid of contaminants on the surface of molten iron. </p><p class="bb-p">When xenon atoms get excited by particles – and despite all the precautions, there are still electrons, gamma rays and an occasional atmospheric muon that make it into the detector – they emit tiny flashes of light, a property shared by several other rare gases. And liquified xenon has a great stopping power – it’s very sensitive to passing particles. </p><p class="bb-p">The light flashes are registered by photo devices and later analysed. So far, all the signals have been discarded. “We are searching for a signal nobody has seen before and this only works if our background is both well-understood and as low as possible,” says Coderre, who’s the former analysis coordinator of XENON1T.</p><p class="bb-p">XENON1T has been running since 2016, and its latest batch of data, published in May, reveals the familiar null results. However, say scientists, the limits they managed to put on the effective size of dark matter particles are the most stringent ever – one-trillionth of one-trillionth of a centimetre squared, or 4.1x10-47 square cm. Effective size, or in science talk ‘cross-section,’ is how strongly WIMPs are thought to be interacting with normal matter – the atoms of xenon. To determine it, researchers sifted through 279 days of data, during which time they were expecting to register up to ten dark matter events. None happened – which means that WIMPs must be even smaller than previously believed.</p><p class="bb-p">There are always two people on shift – ‘shifters’ – either in the underground lab or in the research facility near the mountains, which sports a multitude of offices, a canteen and even a bar. The shifters operate the detector remotely using tablets, constantly keeping an eye on any interesting data readings, to make sure a dark matter particle isn’t missed. In total, about 160 scientists work on the experiment from 26 scientific institutions in the US, EU and Asia.</p><p class="bb-p">To keep the detector extremely clean and minimise contamination by radioactive impurities that can be carried by dust on or in the detector materials, researchers need full clean room garb during assembly, with coats, masks, boots, and so on. Even a fingerprint could ruin years of work. </p><p class="bb-p">Very soon, they will do it all over again – over December and January, XENON1T will be switched off. Researchers will take the detector out, only to replace it over the following months with a much larger one, called XENONnT. The upgrade will cost in the tens of millions of euros, split between the collaboration members. What helps is that the outer tank will stay the same. The inner chamber, though, will be filled with six tonnes of liquid xenon instead of two. The instrument should start processing data by the end of 2019.</p><p class="bb-p">If that detector still finds nothing, researchers here at Gran Sasso are likely to try just one more time with an even larger instrument before moving to different technologies. “The hunt for traditional heavy WIMPs will reach a natural conclusion with the next stage of the LHC and the big XENON dark matter experiments,” says Daniel Bauer from FNAL. “It is still possible these will be found in the next few years but, if they are not, then the standard WIMP hypothesis looks like the wrong answer.”</p><p class="bb-p">While the WIMP detectors keep on searching, more and more researchers are developing other theories about the nature of dark matter and working on experiments to catch it. It’s multi-faceted interrogation of the dark matter puzzle. In the frame are much lighter hypothetical dark matter particles, axions, and neutral particles called sterile neutrinos.</p>

    <p class="bb-p"><span class="bb-dropcap bb-dropcap--letter">I</span>t’s not that axions are a particularly new idea. First thought of in 1977, these particles are supposed to be much lighter than WIMPs but have been in and out of fashion for decades. But now, in light of continuous nothingness from all the various WIMPs catchers, many scientists are considering axions their second-best bet.</p><p class="bb-p">The theory goes that the axion would interact with photons – very weakly, but interact nonetheless. This is how the Axion Dark Matter Experiment (ADMX), housed at the Centre for Experimental Nuclear Physics and Astrophysics at the University of Washington, is trying to catch them. Unlike SNOLAB and XENON1T, ADMX is in a typical physics lab, and consists of a detector in a tank about four metres high. It consists of a very large superconducting magnet and a microwave cavity, and works similarly to a radio receiver, says Gray Rybka, a physicist at the University of Washington. It’s like if the researchers had a radio that’s searching for a radio station, but they have no idea about its frequency – so they are turning the knob, slowly, trying to hear a signal when the frequency is just right.</p><p class="bb-p">The magnet generates a strong magnetic field, and receivers should register the specific electromagnetic radiation produced if an axion were to pass through the field, converting its energy into a weak microwave signal that researchers can detect with quantum electronics. Because the signal the experiment is looking for is expected to be much lower in energy than those produced by cosmic rays or radioactivity, ADMX doesn't have to be shielded by rock or water. It does have to be shielded from mobile phones, Wi-Fi, and television signals. “It literally is a radio receiver. The only difference is that we convert axions into radio waves in the first step of the experiment,” says Rybka.</p><p class="bb-p">ADMX isn’t new – it was built more than two decades ago, in 1995. In 2010, it was moved to the University of Washington from the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. It’s been constantly upgraded though – and finally now, the scientists say, it’s sensitive enough to detect the weak interactions caused by axions.</p><p class="bb-p">The temperature of the ADMX is -273C, only 0.15C above absolute zero – colder than deep space. “There's a great deal of work in the refrigeration operation and moving liquid helium around,” says Rybka. It's liquid helium that keeps the detector so cold, and it's important because the temperature has to be cold enough for the superconducting magnet and quantum electronics to work. Also, the colder the experiment is, the lower the noise, and the clearer a detected signal will be. </p><p class="bb-p">Most times the lab is quiet and empty, because the data acquisition is largely automated. Researchers control and monitor it via the internet day and night, though. About once a year, operation stops, scientists warm the system up to room temperature and pull the internal detector out of the magnet. “This is the most spectacular time to see the lab: everyone is wearing their helmets and cryo-safety gloves as we carefully move the system into a clean room, where we install the new upgrades over the course of a few months,” says Rybka.</p><p class="bb-p">He is convinced that so far, the searches for dark matter “have been looking for the wrong thing”. With ADMX, he says, the equipment is sensitive enough to find just the right signals, and all that is left is to slowly look over the plausible masses. “We've finally got the volume knob turned up enough, and now we just need to turn the frequency knob until we hear the signal,” he says. “Our chances are good. Certainly better than ever before.”</p><p class="bb-p">At the moment, ADMX is looking at frequencies corresponding to the 4G-LTE mobile phone band, but researchers are also developing technologies to explore the Wi-Fi band at higher frequencies and lower frequencies like AM radio. In April, ADMX delivered its latest results – null results, that is. For Rybka, they are important though, because it shows that the detector actually has the correct sensitivity to find the axion. “If we end up with a null result after having swept over all the plausible masses, it would become important in a different way: axions are important to explain some phenomena in nuclear physics, so we expect axions to exist,” he says. “If we don't find axion dark matter, then we're faced with the problem that either we don't understand our nuclear physics, or we don't understand how the early universe works well enough. So a null result would cause our questions to multiply.” </p><p class="bb-p">Plenty of scientists are busy developing alternative approaches to netting dark matter, and many are even looking at alternative theories of gravity that would be able to explain the way our universe works without any need for the exotic dark stuff. However, the recent direct observation of gravitational waves coming from a collision of two neutron stars <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/troubled-times-for-alternatives-to-einsteins-theory-of-gravity/" class="bb-a">helped bury a number of such theories</a>, so the idea that dark matter is out there somewhere is still very much alive.</p>

    <p class="bb-p"><span class="bb-dropcap bb-dropcap--letter">I</span>f we don’t find axions or WIMPs, there’s another back-up: sterile neutrinos. These are theoretical particles supposed to interact only via gravity as opposed to ‘normal’ neutrinos that interact – very weakly – with normal matter.</p><p class="bb-p">The idea is that sterile neutrinos of the right mass might decay producing an X-ray spectral feature – so would be detectable with an X-ray spectrometer. Just like with other experiments, until very recently such instruments did not have sufficient sensitivity and spectral resolution to accurately measure the predicted feature. Then the Japanese space agency, JAXA, together with Nasa, sent its Hitomi satellite into orbit on February 17, 2016, carrying what they hoped would be just the right type of spectrometer. Except it didn’t stay there long – having made some initial observations of the Perseus cluster, Hitomi suddenly died three weeks later, breaking up into five pieces.</p><p class="bb-p">That was a big blow – it cost $273 million to build the doomed satellite. But scientists don’t get fazed easily, and both the Americans and the Japanese have already cobbled together a replacement, a satellite called XRISM (the X-Ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission). On July 1, it was approved in Japan, and will sport two instruments, Resolve – a high-resolution X-ray spectrometer, and Xtend – an imaging instrument. The cost to rebuild the spectrometer has been quoted at $70 million to $90 million.</p><p class="bb-p">The team decided to call the new spectrometer Resolve “to give it a more meaningful name – it resolves X-ray light into its component colours, and to give it a name that reflects the determination of our team to get back to where we were with Hitomi as quickly as possible,” says Richard Kelley, the principal investigator for the US part of the instrument on the Hitomi recovery mission at Nasa. The new spectrometer will detect photons by how much heat they deposit in the detector and will operate at just 0.06 degrees above absolute zero. It will observe clusters of galaxies and individual galaxies, aiming to detect that very specific spectral feature that has the right energy and strength to be the predicted signature of the decay of a sterile neutrino.</p><p class="bb-p">It’s based on the assumption that X-rays are absorbed in small pixels, and convert their energies to heat, which can be precisely measured with microscopic thermometers. Resolve will detect individual X-rays, one at a time, and make a histogram of the energies, which is the spectrum. “We would expect the sterile neutrinos to have a certain amount of energy, and if this energy is in the X-ray band, we can use Resolve to detect individual neutrinos and make a histogram, or spectrum, of their energies,” explains Kelley. If the neutrinos have a very well-defined energy, it will be possible to see this as a narrow feature in the spectrum.</p><p class="bb-p">XRISM should be launched between April 2020 and March 2021, on a JAXA H-IIA rocket from the Tanagashima Space Centre, following the path of Hitomi. And what if XRISM doesn’t find the spectral feature? As usual, detecting nothing is still something. “Rejecting a sterile neutrino as a possible dark matter candidate would reduce the candidate ideas considerably,” says Richard Mushotzky, an astronomer at University of Maryland.</p><p class="bb-p">It seems that with the hunt for dark matter, for the researchers involved, there are two possible outcomes. To quote the famous physicist Enrico Fermi: “If the result confirms the hypothesis, then you've made a measurement. If the result is contrary to the hypothesis, then you've made a discovery.” In the seemingly unending hunt for dark matter, the discovery of nothing means a lot.</p><h4 class="bb-h4">Want to know more about the future of space exploration?</h4><p class="bb-p"><em class="bb-em">This article is part of our <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/topic/wired-on-space" class="bb-a">WIRED on Space</a> series.

																		<p>"Under the terms of the transaction agreement, Cloudera stockholders will own approximately 60% of the equity of the combined company and Hortonworks stockholders will own approximately 40%," the statement said. "Hortonworks stockholders will receive 1.305 common shares of Cloudera for each share of Hortonworks stock owned, which is based on the 10-day average exchange ratio of the two companies' prices through October 1, 2018."</p>
															
																										    														<p>Hortonworks and Cloudera have discussed a deal for a long time, given the companies' complimentary assets and specializations, according to a person familiar with the matter. Hortonworks initially wanted to be sold for a premium but took an at-market deal because it was all-stock, said the person, who asked not to be named because the negotiations were private.</p>
															
																										    														<p>Cloudera's CEO, Tom Reilly, will be CEO of the combined company, and Cloudera's finance chief, Jim Frankola, will be finance chief of the combined company, the statement said. Hortonworks' CEO, Rob Bearden, will be on the board of the combined company, and Cloudera board member Marty Cole will be chairman of the combined firm's board. Morgan Stanley is advising Cloudera, and Qatalyst is advising Hortonworks.</p>
															
																										    														<p>Hortonworks, which spun out of Yahoo, went public in 2014, and Cloudera, which is larger than Hortonworks in terms of market capitalization and revenue, went public in 2017. <a class="inline_quotes" href="//www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=INTC">Intel</a> was a major Cloudera investor. <a class="inline_quotes" href="//www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=AMZN">Amazon's</a> market-leading cloud unit has a distribution of Hadoop software, and another competitor of the companies, MapR, is privately held.</p>
															
																										    														<p>The announcement comes six months after Cloudera stock fell 28 percent after the company announced earnings that came in below analysts' earnings expectations. Reilly told analysts that the company would be <a href="/2018/04/03/cloudera-earnings-q4-2018.html">making changes to its sales organization</a>.</p>
															
																										    														<p>Wednesday's statement said the combined company will have $720 million in annual revenue, based on the year that ended on June 30, and more than 2,500 customers.</p>
															
																										    														<p>"We expect to generate more cash sooner than if we remained independent companies," Reilly said on a conference call after the news was announced on Wednesday.</p>
															
																										    														<p>The two companies are committed to supporting existing offerings from the two companies for at least three years but will work on a "unity release" of software, drawing on technologies from both companies' portfolios, Reilly said. The unified company wants to honor Hortonworks' commitment around providing all of its software under open-source licenses, but over time there will also be a proprietary option that offer additional features, including in the cloud, Reilly said.</p>
															
																										    														<p>The combination of Cloudera and Hortonworks could bring about more than $125 million in annualized savings, including optimizations in sales and research and development, according to an investor presentation. Some roles will be eliminated over time, Frankola said.</p>

            <div><p>“The dream of my Brother I shall remember.” <a href="https://www.laphamsquarterly.org/contributors/samuel-johnson">Samuel Johnson</a> wrote that sentence in his diary on the morning of January 23, 1759. It’s not unreasonable to assume that he did so with some emotion: his mother had been buried the previous day. Above the note about his brother, Nathaniel, he had written a prayer for her:</p>
<blockquote><p>I commend, O Lord, so far as it may be lawful, into thy hands the soul of my departed Mother, beseeching Thee to grant her whatever is most beneficial to her in her present state.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>O Lord grant me thy Holy Spirit, and have mercy upon me for Jesus Christ’s sake. Amen.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And, O Lord, grant unto me that am now about to return to the common comforts and business of the world, such moderation in all enjoyments, such diligence in honest labor, and such purity of mind, that amidst the changes, miseries, or pleasures of life, I may keep my mind fixed upon Thee, and improve every day in grace, till I shall be received into thy kingdom of eternal happiness.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I returned thanks for my Mother’s good example, and implored pardon for neglecting it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I returned thanks for the alleviation of my sorrow.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The dream of my Brother I shall remember.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nowhere else in his extant writing does Johnson refer to that dream. And nowhere else in his many volumes of diaries does he mention his brother, who had died in somewhat murky circumstances in 1737, aged twenty-four.</p>
<p>So we speculate. And we have plenty of matter with which to work—Johnson’s life was documented like few others. “I believe,” he told <a href="https://www.laphamsquarterly.org/contributors/boswell">James Boswell</a> late in his life, “there is hardly a day in which there is not something about me in the newspapers.” Boswell’s landmark biography was only the beginning: in the centuries since, there have been numerous accounts of Johnson’s life, the earliest by those who knew him, later ones by scholars who made ever more exacting use of the ever greater trove of papers and information on Johnson and his era. Johnson continues to have devotees. He is the subject of societies that attract both fans and scholars. Both his boyhood home and his London house have become museums. Three centuries after his birth, Johnson lives.</p>
<p>Even so, in trying to learn more about Johnson’s dream, we face our perpetual enemies: silence, time, and the burning barrel. Boswell, who might have told us more, was reticent about Johnson’s troubled thoughts, though it’s also possible that he never heard about the dream; Johnson loved Boswell but did not confide in him. After Johnson’s death, Boswell did have access to the diaries, and thus knew about at least some of the internal struggles Johnson faced, but his aim was to present a man who was above that—real and alive in his conversation, as quick perhaps to display anger as to show enthusiasm, but exemplary in his mind and thought, untroubled by the doubts that plague us lesser mortals.</p>
<p><img alt="Portrait of James Boswell, by Sir Joshua Reynolds, 1785. National Portrait Gallery, London." title="Portrait of James Boswell, by Sir Joshua Reynolds, 1785. National Portrait Gallery, London." class="media-element file-media-original" src="https://www.laphamsquarterly.org/sites/default/files/reynolds_boswell.png" /></p>
<p>Hester Thrale was a closer confidante than Boswell—until she shocked and disappointed the widowed Johnson by marrying late, thus frustrating his own misguided hopes in that direction—and did know at least something of Nathaniel. In her <em>Anecdotes of Samuel Johnson</em> (1786), published two years after her friend’s death, she wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>Of [Nathaniel’s] manly spirit I have heard his brother speak with pride and pleasure…The two brothers did not, however, much delight in each other’s company, being always rivals for the mother’s fondness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But of the dream she wrote and, presumably, knew, nothing.</p>
<p>What might we speculate? We can start with two premises, both backed by strong evidence: Johnson was a man who felt guilt powerfully, and he likely couldn’t shake a sense that he had not done all he might have for Nathaniel.</p>
<p>Guilt animates a famous incident in Johnson’s life that biographer Peter Martin calls “one of the great images of Johnson’s troubled soul.” That the guilt is familial makes it even more salient. Johnson’s father, Michael, ran a bookshop in the cathedral town of Lichfield, where the family lived. Like many a bookish youth then and now, Johnson found reading books far more interesting than the labor of selling them, and he seems to have done his best to avoid taking shifts either in the shop or at nearby town markets where Michael would set out a stall. According to Henry White, a young clergyman who became a close friend of Johnson’s in the final year of his life, one day Michael, possibly laid low by illness, asked his son to fill in for him at Uttoxeter Market. Johnson refused. “Pride,” he told White, “was the source of that refusal.” But that was far from the end of the episode, either for Johnson or for posterity. <a href="https://www.laphamsquarterly.org/contributors/hawthorne">Nathaniel Hawthorne</a> was so taken by it that he fleshed it out extravagantly to make a lesson for young readers in his didactic <em>Biographical Stories for Children</em> (1842):</p>
<blockquote><p>But when the old man’s figure, as he went stooping along the street, was no more to be seen, the boy’s heart began to smite him. He had a vivid imagination, and it tormented him with the image of his father standing in the marketplace of Uttoxeter and offering his books to the noisy crowd around him…He was standing in the hot sunshine of the marketplace, and looking so weary, sick, and disconsolate that the eyes of all the crowd were drawn to him. “Had this old man no son,” the people would say among themselves, “who might have taken his place at the bookstall while the father kept his bed?” And perhaps—but this was a terrible thought for Sam!—perhaps his father would faint away and fall down in the marketplace, with his gray hair in the dust and his venerable face as deathlike as that of a corpse. And there would be the bystanders gazing earnestly at Mr. Johnson and whispering, “Is he dead? Is he dead?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our childhood failures, particularly those of character, can haunt us like little else. Hawthorne even goes so far as to suggest that this one penetrated Johnson’s dreams:</p>
<blockquote><p>Many and many a time, awake or in his dreams, he seemed to see old Michael Johnson standing in the dust and confusion of the marketplace and pressing his withered hand to his forehead as if it ached.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yet this would be nothing more than a well-remembered incident from childhood were it not for what Johnson did years later (according to Hawthorne, on the fiftieth anniversary of the incident). As Johnson told White:</p>
<blockquote><p>A few years ago I desired to atone for this fault; I went to Uttoxeter in very bad weather, and stood for a considerable time bare-headed in the rain, on the spot where my father’s stall used to stand. In contrition I stood, and I hope the penance was expiatory.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An account from Richard Warner published in 1802 has Johnson offering more detail, though the sourcing is vague:</p>
<blockquote><p>Going into the market at the time of high business, [I] uncovered my head, and stood with it bare an hour before the stall which my father had formerly used, exposed to the sneers of the standers-by and the inclemency of the weather.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Johnson was a figure to occasion remark in any setting: large, shambling, prone to physical tics. Hatless and wigless, head down in silence in the rain, amid a bustling market, he must have been the carefully avoided center of attention, an unforgettable image. The monument to Johnson in Lichfield’s market square displays this scene in bas-relief on one side of a plinth. Hawthorne was so taken by the image of Johnson in the rain that he adapted it for <em>The Scarlet Letter</em>, with Dimmesdale the silent penitent.</p>
<p><img alt="Portrait of Samuel Johnson, print by James Watson, after Sir Joshua Reynolds, 1770. © The Trustees of the British Museum." title="Portrait of Samuel Johnson, print by James Watson, after Sir Joshua Reynolds, 1770. © The Trustees of the British Museum." class="media-element file-media-original" src="https://www.laphamsquarterly.org/sites/default/files/reynolds_johnson.png" /></p>
<p>His father was far from Johnson’s only source of guilt. It shines through the prayers he composed in the wake of his beloved wife’s death, animating them with a pained sense of remorse for things not done, kindnesses not offered, that will be familiar to anyone who has lost a loved one. Nearly all of Johnson’s guilt takes that form: less a regret for actions taken than a deeply religious sense of failing to do what he should have done—fears of squandering what he truly believed were his gifts from God. His journals abound with acknowledgments of failings and resolutions to do better: laments that “this day I have trifled away,” repeated resolutions “to rise early,” reminders to “to do good as occasion offers itself,” even, late in life, “to review former resolutions.” On his twenty-eighth birthday, in what would become an annual habit—and a marker of his abiding preoccupation—he composed a prayer for the year ahead:</p>
<blockquote><p>I have this day entered upon my 28th year. Mayest thou, O God, enable me for Jesus Christ’s sake to spend this in such a manner that I may receive comfort from it at the hour of death and in the day of judgment. Amen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nowhere does Johnson feel so much our contemporary than in his failed resolution-making. Nowhere does he seem further away from our more secular age than in his focus not on self-improvement for its own sake but on the injunctions laid by God.</p>
<p>Though combative in conversation, Johnson was also kind, generous, and loyal—a loving husband to a sometimes quarrelsome wife, keeper of a household that over the years welcomed more and more strange characters who had no other place to go, like the blind poet Anna Williams and the quack doctor Henry Levet. Friendship was powerfully important to him: in a poem of that name he called it the “peculiar boon of Heaven / The noble mind’s delight and pride.” In <em>The Rambler</em> he wrote, “Life has no pleasure higher or nobler than that of friendship”; to let it die, he wrote elsewhere, “is voluntarily to throw away one of the greatest comforts of the weary pilgrimage.” He remained in contact with and loyal to friends of his youth and those who had shown him kindness when he was an awkward young man of no accomplishment. One of his most public acts of compassion seems likely to have been sparked by friendship: asked by his neighbor and friend Edmund Allen to write in support of William Dodd, a clergyman who had confessed to forgery, Johnson quickly undertook a multipart campaign. That it was in vain—Dodd was hanged—doesn’t lessen the commitment.</p>
<p>Yet this man—accomplished, beloved, loyal—feared death and the terrible judgment he was sure he would find there. Boswell records an unforgettable conversation on the subject. “As I cannot be <em>sure</em> that I have fulfilled the conditions on which salvation is granted,” Johnson says, “I am afraid I may be one of those who shall be damned.” Asked what he meant by that, Johnson replied—with, says Boswell, passion and volume—“Sent to hell, sir, and punished everlastingly.” Another time, all but breaking down amid a discussion of death, he cried, “I have made no preparation for the grave. What shall I do to be saved?” His successes, his kindnesses, his good character—all were as naught against his sense that he could have done better, as enjoined upon him by God, with damnation the inevitable outcome of failure.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong class="dropcap">W</strong>hich returns us to the subject of Nathaniel. Our knowledge of the life and death of his younger brother is scanty. Johnson biographer James Clifford calls him “at best, a shadowy figure.” Johnson’s notes for his dictionary offer a cryptic clue about Nathaniel’s character: next to a quotation from John Norris’ <em>Miscellanies</em> positing that Jesus suffered more than ordinary men because of his sensitivity, Johnson wrote, “My brother.” Clifford, at least, reads the note as referring to run-of-the-mill men: “Nathaniel was not the kind of man who allowed little things to affect his mood.” It’s hard not to wonder, however, whether (without the presumption this might indicate) he meant to compare his brother to Jesus. Nathaniel was hearty and convivial, but might he also have shared some of his brother’s sensitivity?</p>
<p>Born in 1712, Nathaniel became a bookbinder (an occupation that made up a large part of the work of bookselling in those days), and by 1734 at the latest seems to have taken over the family bookshop from his widowed mother. By 1736 he was running a branch of the shop in Burton-on-Trent. That summer, something happened that seems likely to remain forever obscure but comes down to us as certainly discreditable, perhaps even dishonest. Some biographers have speculated that it involved a minor forgery (which could explain Johnson’s eagerness to help the Reverend Dodd years later). What little we do know comes from a plaintive letter Nathaniel sent his mother on September 30 of that year:</p>
<blockquote><p>I have neither money nor credit to buy one quire of paper. It is true I did make a positive bargain for a shop at Stourbridge in which I believe I might have lived happily and had I gone when I first desired it none of these crimes had been committed which have given both you and me so much trouble. I don’t know that you ever denied me part of the working tools but you never told me you would give or lend them me. As to my brother’s assisting me I had but little reason to expect it when he would scarce ever use me with common civility and to whose advice was owing that unwillingness you showed to my going to Stourbridge. If I should ever be able I would make my Stourbridge friends amends for the trouble and charge I have put them to. I know not nor do I much care in what way of life I shall hereafter live, but this I know that it shall be an honest one and that it can’t be more unpleasant than some part of my life past. I believe I shall go to Georgia in about a fortnight, cottons things I will send. I thank you heartily for your generous forgiveness and your prayers,which pray continue. Have courage my dear Mother God will bear you through all your troubles. If my brother did design doing anything for me I am much obliged to him and thank him, give my service to him and my sister I wish them both well.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We don’t know for certain what Johnson did or did not do for Nathaniel in his extremity. At the time Johnson was in the midst of watching the slow failure of the school he had opened and was far from flush, should money have been all that was needed. Nathaniel’s tone, however, suggests that other support was just as desirable—perhaps even something as simple as encouragement and a few introductions. Clifford thinks that Johnson perhaps remained reluctant to offer such help because he preferred not to have his brother settle at Stourbridge, where Johnson had lived for a while and made some fairly prominent social connections. He may have feared the taint to his reputation that might arise from the presence of his rackety and unreliable brother. Regardless of the reasons, it does seem likely that Johnson refused Nathaniel. It’s not hard to imagine him, young and with an eye to his own honor and hopes of success, doing so in a high-handed manner.</p>
<p>Nathaniel did not make good on his resolution to move to Georgia, preventing him from joining George Keats in the category of American immigrant brothers of English literary greats. Knowledge of his movements within England peters out at that point, however. Not even Johnson seems to have known much about his brother’s life in the wake of the mysterious incident. Late in life he wrote to a Miss Prowse near Frome, asking if she could have her servants “collect any little tradition that my yet remain, of one Johnson, who more than forty years ago was for a short time a bookbinder or stationer in that town.” Receiving no useful information, he wrote again to supply additional details—yet still not identifying himself as Nathaniel’s brother:</p>
<blockquote><p>What can be known of him must start up by accident. He was not a native of your town or country, but an adventurer who came from a distant part in quest of a livelihood, and did not stay a year. He came in ’36, and went away in ’37. He was likely enough to attract notice while he stayed, as a lively noisy man that loved company. His memory might probably continue for some time in some favorite alehouse. But after so many years perhaps there is no man left that remembers him. He was my near relation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If he received an answer, there is no record.</p>
<p><img alt="David Garrick as Richard III, by William Hogarth, c. 1745. Walker Art Gallery." title="David Garrick as Richard III, by William Hogarth, c. 1745. Walker Art Gallery." class="media-element file-media-original" src="https://www.laphamsquarterly.org/sites/default/files/hogarth_garrick.png" /></p>
<p>By 1737 Nathaniel was back in the family home in Lichfield. On March 5—days after Johnson and his pupil David Garrick set out on their journey to try their fortunes in London—he died. Speculation has abounded in the centuries since. Surely Johnson would not have left Lichfield at that moment if Nathaniel had been mortally unwell? Given Nathaniel’s despondent tone in his letter to his mother, it’s long been posited that he killed himself. His burial in consecrated ground would seem to rule that out, however, as would the epitaph the militantly honest Johnson ordered inscribed on the family grave, alongside new epitaphs for his mother and father, in his final days of life, when mortality turned his mind to their memory:</p>
<blockquote><p>With them is their son Nathaniel, born in 1712, whose powers of mind and body held out great promise, but his short life ended with a pious death in the year 1737.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Regardless of the manner of Nathaniel’s death, it’s hard not to imagine that a man as prone to guilt—and in particular to guilt over things undone—as Johnson would not have carried it as a burden.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong class="dropcap">T</strong>hough Johnson gave continual thought to the fate of his soul in the afterlife, like more heedless men he neglected the prosaic aspects of death until it was upon him. He made no will until his final days, and even as death’s arrival began to seem inevitable, “he procrastinated that business,” wrote his friend and eventual biographer John Hawkins. Only Hawkins’ reminder that dying intestate would drag his relations into litigation prodded him into action; even then, he so little wanted to attend to the details that when Hawkins presented an outline, Johnson tried to get him to take it away and fill in the blanks for the beneficiaries himself.</p>
<p>About two weeks before his death, Johnson undertook—with the help of his longtime servant Francis Barber—one last act of much-delayed preparation, described here by Boswell:</p>
<blockquote><p>The consideration of the numerous papers of which he was possessed, seems to have struck Johnson’s mind with a sudden anxiety, and as they were in great confusion, it is much to be lamented that he had not entrusted some faithful and discreet person with the care and selection of them; instead of which, he, in a precipitate manner, burnt large masses of them, with little regard, as I apprehend, to discrimination.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Those final weeks, wracked with pain, saw him standing for hours at the burning barrel. One item that Boswell claims Johnson burned was a two-volume “full, fair, and most particular account of his own life, from his earliest recollection.” His mother’s letters, too, went into the flames. Any word to be found in either regarding Nathaniel became smoke and ash.</p>
<p><img alt="Samuel Johnson and his servant Francis at home at Bolt Court, Fleet Street, London, by Charles Tomkins, 1801. © The Trustees of the British Museum." title="Samuel Johnson and his servant Francis at home at Bolt Court, Fleet Street, London, by Charles Tomkins, 1801. © The Trustees of the British Museum." class="media-element file-media-original" src="https://www.laphamsquarterly.org/sites/default/files/bolt_court.png" /></p>
<p>Johnson feared damnation. Today, fewer of us than in Johnson’s time are likely to dwell on that risk in our final hours. Many, perhaps most, of us remain frightened of oblivion, however. Have we left anything that will last? How quickly will the memory of our steps on this earth fade? For all his doubt, Samuel Johnson knew from at least midlife, with the publication of his dictionary, that he had made a mark. His name, at minimum, would carry through the years. As he aged, he surely began to realize that more of him would linger at least for a few generations—he had too many well-connected friends who were too fond of an anecdote to let his memory wholly fade. He likely didn’t imagine how long it would last, or how extensively detailed our knowledge of his life would be. I suspect most subjects of contemporary biographies, even those who had lived their lives in public, would be horrified at the display of their most intimate details the form entails today. That there has never been a biography of Johnson that’s not admiring would be only partial mitigation. Yet perhaps Johnson, ever the teacher, would be able to see his life as a lesson, a reminder that, as he put it in <em>The Adventurer</em>, it is “reasonable to have <em>perfection</em> in our eye; that we may always advance towards it, though we know it never can be reached.”</p>
<p>What, however, of Nathaniel? His fate is the one unfairly meted out to the everyday people caught up in the train of the famous, their lives reaching us only to the extent that they intersected theirs. Nathaniel must have had his fears of death, damnation, and oblivion, too. But he had no assurances about his memory. Would he have wanted them, on terms he played so little part in setting? His life could hardly have been more ordinary; even its early close was less uncommon then than it would be now. It is the very model of an unremarked life in the era of record-keeping: were it not for his brother, there would be but a handful of notices of his existence and passing buried in parish registers, unread.</p>
<p>Yet because of his brother, Nathaniel lives, in a sense. Our knowledge is modest. Time denies us key facts. But the hints we have sketch an outline. His wounded letter to his mother suggests a prickly pride, and perhaps a jealousy of his more talented brother. From Johnson himself we have the comment about Nathaniel’s “manly spirit.” What I return to, however, is Johnson’s late-in-life letter seeking information about his brother, with its thought that Nathaniel might be remembered, one presumes fondly, in a local bar: “He was likely enough to attract notice while he stayed, as a lively noisy man, that loved company. His memory might probably continue for some time in some favorite alehouse.” That prospect carries a kind of pathetic beauty, as does Johnson’s acknowledgment of it. There are worse fates than to be remembered for a time in one’s local.</p>
<p><em>The dream of my Brother I shall remember</em>. We can’t know the dream. We never knew the brother. But we’ll remember him.</p>

        <h2><span>Cross-Origin Resource Sharing</span></h2>
<p><i><span>No ‘Access-Control-Allow-Origin’ header is present on the requested resource. Origin </span></i><a href="http://xyz.com:8080"><i><span>http://www.sesamestreet.com</span></i></a> <i><span> is therefore not allowed access.</span></i></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>If you work with a frontend sometimes, the chances are that you’ve seen the error above before. When it had happened to you for the first time, like any proper developer does, you googled it. As a result, you have probably seen some advice on StackOverflow to include </span><span><code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</code></span><span> in your server’s response and then, you can happily return to your code.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>Surprisingly, this is the end of the experience with Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for many developers. They know how to fix the problem, but they don’t always understand why the problem exists in the first place. In this article, we will dive deeper into this topic, trying to understand what problem CORS really solves. However, we will start with the Same-Origin Policy (SOP) concept.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><span>What Is the Same-Origin Policy?</span></h2>
<p><span>SOP is a security mechanism implemented in almost all of the modern browsers. It does not allow documents or scripts loaded from one origin to access resources from other origins. To understand why it’s so critical, it’s important to realize that for any HTTP request to a particular domain, browsers automatically attach any cookies bounded to that domain. Let’s imagine a cookie <code>my_cookie=oreo</code> which is stored for the domain CookieMonster.com.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-638" src="http://performantcode.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/cookie_1.jpg" alt="" width="601" height="71" /></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>CookieMonster.com is a single-page application that uses REST API exposed at CookieMonster.com/api. Thus, for every HTTP call to the API, <code>my_cookie=oreo</code> will be attached to the request. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>Without Same-Origin Policy, the following scenario would be possible:</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-642" src="http://performantcode.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/cookie_2.jpg" alt="" width="602" height="71" /></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>SesameStreet.com could reuse the user’s cookie which was previously stored for CookieMonster.com. Sounds scary? Not yet? Let’s look at the more thought-provoking scenario:</span><span><br /></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-645" src="http://performantcode.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/cookie_3.jpg" alt="" width="601" height="78" /></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>and then:</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-646" src="http://performantcode.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/cookie_4.jpg" alt="" width="601" height="78" /></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Without SOP, MaliciousWebsite.com would be able to send a request to MyBank.com/api using the session cookie stored for MyBank.com. Why is that? Because, as previously mentioned, browsers automatically attach cookies bounded to a destination domain. It doesn’t matter if a request originated from MyBank.com or MaliciousWebsite.com. As long as a request goes to MyBank.com, the cookies stored for MyBank.com would be used. As you can see, without Same-Origin Policy, Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack can be relatively simple – assuming that an authentication is based solely on a session cookie, as opposed to a token-based authentication. That’s one of the reasons the SOP was introduced.</p>
<p>Having said that, it has always been possible for the browser to make cross-origin requests by specifying a resource from a foreign domain in the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> tag – and if applicable, cookies might be attached. The crucial difference is that AJAX call is fired from the JavaScript code, which has total control and can be potentially dangerous. On the other hand, tags are in the control of the browser, and no JS code can intercept HTTP requests that they trigger.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><span>What is Origin?</span></h3>
<p><span>In the previous paragraph, I used domains as an example. But Same-Origin Policy applies to origins. How is an origin defined? Two origins are considered to be equal if they have the same protocol, host, and port – sometimes referred to as “scheme/host/port tuple”. It explains why we see this error – even if both our backend and frontend run locally – they use different ports, and thus, they have different origins.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><span>What Is CORS?</span></h2>
<p><span>Even though some people call CORS a security mechanism, it’s actually the opposite. It’s a way to relax security, make it less restrictive. SOP is implemented in almost all modern browsers and because of that, a website from one origin is not allowed to access resources from foreign origins. CORS is a mechanism to make it possible.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><span>How Does CORS Work?</span></h3>
<p><span>CORS defines two types of requests: simple requests and preflighted requests.</span></p>
<h4><span>Simple Requests</span></h4>
<p><span>To put it simply, a simple request is the one that doesn’t trigger the preflight request. A request doesn’t trigger preflight request if it meets all of the following conditions:</span></p>
<ul><li><span>uses GET, HEAD or POST method</span></li>
<li><span>doesn’t have headers other than the small subset defined in the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS#Simple_requests">specification</a> (any custom or Authorization header breaks this condition)</span></li>
<li><span>the only allowed values for Content-Type header are <code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code></span><span>, <code>multipart/form-data</code>, <code>text/plain</code> (<code>application/json </code></span><span>breaks this condition</span><span>)</span></li>
</ul><p> </p>
<p><span>A typical scenario would be:</span></p>
<p><span>1. SesameStreet.com</span><span> is opened in a browser tab. It initiates AJAX request (using XMLHttpRequest or Fetch API) to GET </span><span>CookieMonster.com/api/monsters</span></p>
<p><span>2. The browser notices that this is a cross-origin request, and attaches Origin request header:</span></p>

<p>3. <span>The CORS-configured server checks the Origin header and if the origin is allowed, then it sets the <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</code> header to the Origin value:</span></p>

					</tr></table></div>
		</div>


<p>4. <span>When the response reaches the browser, the browser verifies if the value under <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</code> header matches the origin of the tab the request originated from.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h4><span>Preflighted Requests</span></h4>
<p><span>As described earlier, even adding a header such as Authorization causes a request to be preflighted. A request is preflighted if a browser first sends an additional preliminary OPTIONS request (“preflight request”) in order to determine whether the actual request (“preflighted request”) is safe to send. Let’s look at the typical flow where we want to create a new monster resource:</span></p>
<p>1. <span>A browser tab with </span><span>SesameStreet.com</span><span> makes AJAX POST request to </span><span>CookieMonster.com/api/monsters</span><span> with a JSON payload using POST method. The browser knows that sending POST with Content-Type different from </span><span><code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code></span><span>, <code>multipart/form-data</code>, <code>text/plain</code></span><span> </span><span>has to be preflighted, so it sends OPTIONS request with three additional parameters:</span></p>
<ul><li><span>Origin – this one we already know</span></li>
<li><span>Access-Control-Request-Method – HTTP method of the main (preflighted) request</span></li>
<li><span>Access-Control-Request-Headers – HTTP headers of the main (preflighted) request</span></li>
</ul><div class="crayon-syntax crayon-theme-sublime-text crayon-font-monaco crayon-os-pc print-yes notranslate">
		
			
			
			<p>

<p>3. <span>If the origin is allowed and if the HTTP method and headers of the main request are on the list returned by the server, the main request can be sent. This will be a regular cross-origin request, so it will include Origin header and the response will contain <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</code> once again.</span></p>
<p><span>Performance note: </span><span>sending a preflight request every time can be a performance overhead. This can be mitigated by caching preflight requests using Access-Control-Max-Age response header.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><span>Common Misconception About CORS</span></h2>
<p><span>At the first glance, CORS configuration on a server side looks like some sort of ACL (Access Control List) – a server returns the origin that it accepts requests from. The only way to access a resource is to send a request from the origin whitelisted by a server, right? Not really. Remember that HTTP isn’t used only by browsers and you can send an HTTP request from any client like curl, Postman, and so on. If you prepare a custom HTTP request in those tools, you can put any Origin header you want. You can also skip it and a server usually returns a correct result anyway. Why is that? Because as I mentioned earlier, Same-Origin Policy is a concept implemented in browsers. Other tools or software components don’t care about it that much.</span><span><br /></span><span><br /></span><span><br /></span><span>There is a simple implication based on what you’ve just read. If there is a third-party API which you want your webpage to consume, but the API returns Access-Control-Allow-Origin header set to an origin other than your own, then you can circumvent that problem by setting up a proxy server. Why? Because as described above, SOP doesn’t apply to server-to-server communication, only to browser-to-server one.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><span>Is CORS Safe?</span></h2>
<p><span>The most important question – is the CSRF scenario from the beginning of this article possible using CORS? The answer is that it depends. By default, </span><b>CORS does not include cookies into cross-origin requests</b><span>. This is different from older cross-origin techniques, such as JSON-P (JSON with Padding). This behavior greatly reduces CSRF vulnerabilities. However, if you really want to send cookies in your request, you can explicitly permit that. This requires coordination between both the client and the server side. Your website must set <code>withCredentials</code> property on the XMLHttpRequest to <code>true</code> (or <code>credentials</code> property in Fetch API set to <code>include</code>). Additionally, the server must respond with <code>Access-Control-Allow-Credentials</code> header set to <code>true</code>. With this combination, both parties agree to use credentials when sending a cross-origin request. Credentials are cookies, authorization headers or TLS client certificates. Thankfully, there is one security measure that prevents an excessive exhibitionism – the following combination won’t work:</span><span><br /></span></p>

<p><span>If you allow credentials to be sent, then <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</code> cannot be set to the wildcard. The server must return an explicit origin that is allowed to access the resource. The bad news is that many servers blindly generate the <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</code> header based on the Origin value from the user’s request. If that’s the case, using <code>Access-Control-Allow-Credentials</code> set to <code>true</code> can be a serious security hole.</span></p>

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" href="#section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   Zstandard, or "zstd" (pronounced "zee standard"), is a data
   compression mechanism, akin to gzip [<a href="./rfc1952" title="&quot;GZIP file format specification version 4.3&quot;">RFC1952</a>].

   Despite use of the word "standard" as part of its name, readers are
   advised that this document is not an Internet Standards Track
   specification; it is being published for informational purposes only.

   This document describes the Zstandard format.  Also, to enable the
   transport of a data object compressed with Zstandard, this document
   registers a media type that can be used to identify such content when
   it is used in a payload encoded using Multipurpose Internet Mail
   Extensions (MIME).

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" href="#section-2">2</a>.  Definitions</span>

   Some terms used elsewhere in this document are defined here for
   clarity.

   uncompressed:  Describes an arbitrary set of bytes in their original
      form, prior to being subjected to compression.

   compress, compression:  The act of processing a set of bytes via the
      compression mechanism described here.

   compressed:  Describes the result of passing a set of bytes through
      this mechanism.  The original input has thus been compressed.

   decompress, decompression:  The act of processing a set of bytes
      through the inverse of the compression mechanism described here,
      in an attempt to recover the original set of bytes prior to
      compression.

   decompressed:  Describes the result of passing a set of bytes through
      the reverse of this mechanism.  When this is successful, the
      decompressed payload and the uncompressed payload are
      indistinguishable.

   encode:  The process of translating data from one form to another;
      this may include compression or it may refer to other translations
      done as part of this specification.

   decode:  The reverse of "encode"; describes a process of reversing a
      prior encoding to recover the original content.

   frame:  Content compressed by Zstandard is transformed into a
      Zstandard frame.  Multiple frames can be appended into a single
      file or stream.  A frame is completely independent, has a defined
      beginning and end, and has a set of parameters that tells the
      decoder how to decompress it.

   block:  A frame encapsulates one or multiple blocks.  Each block
      contains arbitrary content, which is described by its header, and
      has a guaranteed maximum content size that depends upon frame
      parameters.  Unlike frames, each block depends on previous blocks
      for proper decoding.  However, each block can be decompressed
      without waiting for its successor, allowing streaming operations.

   natural order:  A sequence or ordering of objects or values that is
      typical of that type of object or value.  A set of unique
      integers, for example, is in "natural order" if when progressing
      from one element in the set or sequence to the next, there is
      never a decrease in value.

   The naming convention for identifiers within the specification is
   Mixed_Case_With_Underscores.  Identifiers inside square brackets
   indicate that the identifier is optional in the presented context.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" href="#section-3">3</a>.  Compression Algorithm</span>

   This section describes the Zstandard algorithm.

   The purpose of this document is to define a lossless compressed data
   format that is a) independent of the CPU type, operating system, file
   system, and character set and b) is suitable for file compression and
   pipe and streaming compression, using the Zstandard algorithm.  The
   text of the specification assumes a basic background in programming
   at the level of bits and other primitive data representations.

   The data can be produced or consumed, even for an arbitrarily long
   sequentially presented input data stream, using only an a priori
   bounded amount of intermediate storage, and hence can be used in data
   communications.  The format uses the Zstandard compression method,
   and an optional xxHash-64 checksum method [<a href="#ref-XXHASH" title="&quot;XXHASH Algorithm&quot;">XXHASH</a>], for detection of
   data corruption.

   The data format defined by this specification does not attempt to
   allow random access to compressed data.

   Unless otherwise indicated below, a compliant compressor must produce
   data sets that conform to the specifications presented here.
   However, it does not need to support all options.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc8478">RFC 8478</a>                    application/zstd                October 2018</span>


   A compliant decompressor must be able to decompress at least one
   working set of parameters that conforms to the specifications
   presented here.  It may also ignore informative fields, such as the
   checksum.  Whenever it does not support a parameter defined in the
   compressed stream, it must produce a non-ambiguous error code and
   associated error message explaining which parameter is unsupported.

   This specification is intended for use by implementers of software to
   compress data into Zstandard format and/or decompress data from
   Zstandard format.  The Zstandard format is supported by an open
   source reference implementation, written in portable C, and available
   at [<a href="#ref-ZSTD" title="&quot;Zstandard&quot;">ZSTD</a>].

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1">3.1</a>.  Frames</span>

   Zstandard compressed data is made up of one or more frames.  Each
   frame is independent and can be decompressed independently of other
   frames.  The decompressed content of multiple concatenated frames is
   the concatenation of each frame's decompressed content.

   There are two frame formats defined for Zstandard: Zstandard frames
   and skippable frames.  Zstandard frames contain compressed data,
   while skippable frames contain custom user metadata.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1.1">3.1.1</a>.  Zstandard Frames</span>

   The structure of a single Zstandard frame is as follows:

     +--------------------+------------+
     |    Magic_Number    | 4 bytes    |
     +--------------------+------------+
     |    Frame_Header    | 2-14 bytes |
     +--------------------+------------+
     |     Data_Block     | n bytes    |
     +--------------------+------------+
     | [More Data_Blocks] |            |
     +--------------------+------------+
     | [Content_Checksum] | 0-4 bytes  |
     +--------------------+------------+

   Magic_Number:  4 bytes, little-endian format.  Value: 0xFD2FB528.

   Frame_Header:  2 to 14 bytes, detailed in <a href="#section-3.1.1.1">Section 3.1.1.1</a>.

   Data_Block:  Detailed in <a href="#section-3.1.1.2">Section 3.1.1.2</a>.  This is where data
      appears.





<span class="grey">Collet &amp; Kucherawy            Informational                     [Page 6]</span></pre>
<hr class="noprint" style="margin-left:0;margin-right:auto;text-align:left;" /><pre class="newpage"><a href="#page-7" class="invisible"> </a>
<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc8478">RFC 8478</a>                    application/zstd                October 2018</span>


   Content_Checksum:  An optional 32-bit checksum, only present if
      Content_Checksum_Flag is set.  The content checksum is the result
      of the XXH64() hash function [<a href="#ref-XXHASH" title="&quot;XXHASH Algorithm&quot;">XXHASH</a>] digesting the original
      (decoded) data as input, and a seed of zero.  The low 4 bytes of
      the checksum are stored in little-endian format.

   The magic number was selected to be less probable to find at the
   beginning of an arbitrary file.  It avoids trivial patterns (0x00,
   0xFF, repeated bytes, increasing bytes, etc.), contains byte values
   outside of ASCII range, and doesn't map into UTF-8 space, all of
   which reduce the likelihood of its appearance at the top of a text
   file.

<span class="h5"><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1.1.1">3.1.1.1</a>.  Frame Header</span>

   The frame header has a variable size, with a minimum of 2 bytes and
   up to 14 bytes depending on optional parameters.  The structure of
   Frame_Header is as follows:

     +-------------------------+-----------+
     | Frame_Header_Descriptor | 1 byte    |
     +-------------------------+-----------+
     |   [Window_Descriptor]   | 0-1 byte  |
     +-------------------------+-----------+
     |     [Dictionary_ID]     | 0-4 bytes |
     +-------------------------+-----------+
     |  [Frame_Content_Size]   | 0-8 bytes |
     +-------------------------+-----------+























<span class="grey">Collet &amp; Kucherawy            Informational                     [Page 7]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc8478">RFC 8478</a>                    application/zstd                October 2018</span>


<span class="h6"><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1.1.1.1">3.1.1.1.1</a>.  Frame_Header_Descriptor</span>

   The first header's byte is called the Frame_Header_Descriptor.  It
   describes which other fields are present.  Decoding this byte is
   enough to tell the size of Frame_Header.

     +------------+-------------------------+
     | Bit Number | Field Name              |
     +------------+-------------------------+
     |    7-6     | Frame_Content_Size_Flag |
     +------------+-------------------------+
     |     5      | Single_Segment_Flag     |
     +------------+-------------------------+
     |     4      | (unused)                |
     +------------+-------------------------+
     |     3      | (reserved)              |
     +------------+-------------------------+
     |     2      | Content_Checksum_Flag   |
     +------------+-------------------------+
     |    1-0     | Dictionary_ID_Flag      |
     +------------+-------------------------+

   In this table, bit 7 is the highest bit, while bit 0 is the lowest
   one.

<span class="h6"><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1.1.1.1.1">3.1.1.1.1.1</a>.  Frame_Content_Size_Flag</span>

   This is a 2-bit flag (equivalent to Frame_Header_Descriptor right-
   shifted 6 bits) specifying whether Frame_Content_Size (the
   decompressed data size) is provided within the header.  Flag_Value
   provides FCS_Field_Size, which is the number of bytes used by
   Frame_Content_Size according to the following table:

     +----------------+--------+---+---+---+

     +----------------+--------+---+---+---+
     | FCS_Field_Size | 0 or 1 | 2 | 4 | 8 |
     +----------------+--------+---+---+---+

   When Flag_Value is 0, FCS_Field_Size depends on Single_Segment_Flag:
   If Single_Segment_Flag is set, FCS_Field_Size is 1.  Otherwise,
   FCS_Field_Size is 0; Frame_Content_Size is not provided.

<span class="h6"><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1.1.1.1.2">3.1.1.1.1.2</a>.  Single_Segment_Flag</span>

   If this flag is set, data must be regenerated within a single
   continuous memory segment.

   In this case, Window_Descriptor byte is skipped, but
   Frame_Content_Size is necessarily present.  As a consequence, the
   decoder must allocate a memory segment of size equal or larger than
   Frame_Content_Size.

   In order to protect the decoder from unreasonable memory
   requirements, a decoder is allowed to reject a compressed frame that
   requests a memory size beyond the decoder's authorized range.

   For broader compatibility, decoders are recommended to support memory
   sizes of at least 8 MB.  This is only a recommendation; each decoder
   is free to support higher or lower limits, depending on local
   limitations.

<span class="h6"><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1.1.1.1.3">3.1.1.1.1.3</a>.  Unused Bit</span>

   A decoder compliant with this specification version shall not

<span class="h6"><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1.1.1.1.4">3.1.1.1.1.4</a>.  Reserved Bit</span>

   This bit is reserved for some future feature.  Its value must be

<span class="h6"><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1.1.1.1.6">3.1.1.1.1.6</a>.  Dictionary_ID_Flag</span>

   This is a 2-bit flag (= Frame_Header_Descriptor &amp; 0x3) indicating
   whether a dictionary ID is provided within the header.  It also
   specifies the size of this field as DID_Field_Size:

     +----------------+---+---+---+---+
     | Flag_Value     | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 |
     +----------------+---+---+---+---+

     +----------------+---+---+---+---+

<span class="h6"><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1.1.1.2">3.1.1.1.2</a>.  Window Descriptor</span>

   This provides guarantees about the minimum memory buffer required to
   decompress a frame.  This information is important for decoders to
   allocate enough memory.

   The Window_Descriptor byte is optional.  When Single_Segment_Flag is
   set, Window_Descriptor is not present.  In this case, Window_Size is
   Frame_Content_Size, which can be any value from 0 to 2^64-1 bytes (16
   ExaBytes).

     +------------+----------+----------+
     | Bit Number |   7-3    |   2-0    |
     +------------+----------+----------+
     | Field Name | Exponent | Mantissa |
     +------------+----------+----------+

   The minimum memory buffer size is called Window_Size.  It is
   described by the following formulae:

     windowLog = 10 + Exponent;
     windowBase = 1 &lt;&lt; windowLog;
     windowAdd = (windowBase / 8) * Mantissa;
     Window_Size = windowBase + windowAdd;

   The minimum Window_Size is 1 KB.  The maximum Window_Size is (1&lt;&lt;41)
   + 7*(1&lt;&lt;38) bytes, which is 3.75 TB.

   In general, larger Window_Size values tend to improve the compression
   ratio, but at the cost of increased memory usage.

   To properly decode compressed data, a decoder will need to allocate a
   buffer of at least Window_Size bytes.

   In order to protect decoders from unreasonable memory requirements, a
   decoder is allowed to reject a compressed frame that requests a
   memory size beyond decoder's authorized range.

   For improved interoperability, it's recommended for decoders to
   support values of Window_Size up to 8 MB and for encoders not to
   generate frames requiring a Window_Size larger than 8 MB.  It's
   merely a recommendation though, and decoders are free to support
   larger or lower limits, depending on local limitations.

<span class="h6"><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1.1.1.3">3.1.1.1.3</a>.  Dictionary_ID</span>

   This is a variable size field, which contains the ID of the
   dictionary required to properly decode the frame.  This field is
   optional.  When it's not present, it's up to the decoder to know
   which dictionary to use.

   Dictionary_ID field size is provided by DID_Field_Size.
   DID_Field_Size is directly derived from the value of
   Dictionary_ID_Flag.  One byte can represent an ID 0-255; 2 bytes can
   represent an ID 0-65535; 4 bytes can represent an ID 0-4294967295.
   Format is little-endian.

   It is permitted to represent a small ID (for example, 13) with a
   large 4-byte dictionary ID, even if it is less efficient.

   Within private environments, any dictionary ID can be used.  However,
   for frames and dictionaries distributed in public space,
   Dictionary_ID must be attributed carefully.  The following ranges are
   reserved for use only with dictionaries that have been registered
   with IANA (see <a href="#section-6.3">Section 6.3</a>):

   low range:  &lt;= 32767
   high range:  &gt;= (1 &lt;&lt; 31)

   Any other value for Dictionary_ID can be used by private arrangement
   between participants.

   Any payload presented for decompression that references an
   unregistered reserved dictionary ID results in an error.

<span class="h6"><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1.1.1.4">3.1.1.1.4</a>.  Frame Content Size</span>

   This is the original (uncompressed) size.  This information is
   optional.  Frame_Content_Size uses a variable number of bytes,
   provided by FCS_Field_Size.  FCS_Field_Size is provided by the value
   of Frame_Content_Size_Flag.  FCS_Field_Size can be equal to 0 (not
   present), 1, 2, 4, or 8 bytes.

     +----------------+--------------+
     | FCS Field Size | Range        |
     +----------------+--------------+
     |        0       | unknown      |
     +----------------+--------------+
     |        1       | 0 - 255      |

     +----------------+--------------+
     |        8       | 0 - 2^64 - 1 |
     +----------------+--------------+

   Frame_Content_Size format is little-endian.  When FCS_Field_Size is
   1, 4, or 8 bytes, the value is read directly.  When FCS_Field_Size is
   2, the offset of 256 is added.  It's allowed to represent a small
   size (for example 18) using any compatible variant.

<span class="h5"><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1.1.2">3.1.1.2</a>.  Blocks</span>

   After Magic_Number and Frame_Header, there are some number of blocks.
   Each frame must have at least 1 block, but there is no upper limit on
   the number of blocks per frame.

   The structure of a block is as follows:

     +--------------+---------------+
     | Block_Header | Block_Content |
     +--------------+---------------+
     |    3 bytes   |    n bytes    |
     +--------------+---------------+

   Block_Header uses 3 bytes, written using little-endian convention.
   It contains three fields:

     +------------+------------+------------+
     | Last_Block | Block_Type | Block_Size |
     +------------+------------+------------+
     |    bit 0   |   bits 1-2 |  bits 3-23 |
     +------------+------------+------------+

<span class="h6"><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1.1.2.1">3.1.1.2.1</a>.  Last_Block</span>

   The lowest bit (Last_Block) signals whether this block is the last
   one.  The frame will end after this last block.  It may be followed
   by an optional Content_Checksum (see <a href="#section-3.1.1">Section 3.1.1</a>).

<span class="h6"><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1.1.2.2">3.1.1.2.2</a>.  Block_Type</span>

   The next 2 bits represent the Block_Type.  There are four block
   types:

     +-----------+------------------+
     |   Value   |    Block_Type    |
     +-----------+------------------+
     |     0     |     Raw_Block    |
     +-----------+------------------+
     |     1     |     RLE_Block    |

     +-----------+------------------+
     |     3     |     Reserved     |
     +-----------+------------------+

   Raw_Block:  This is an uncompressed block.  Block_Content contains
      Block_Size bytes.

   RLE_Block:  This is a single byte, repeated Block_Size times.
      Block_Content consists of a single byte.  On the decompression
      side, this byte must be repeated Block_Size times.

   Compressed_Block:  This is a compressed block as described in
      <a href="#section-3.1.1.3">Section 3.1.1.3</a>.  Block_Size is the length of Block_Content,
      namely the compressed data.  The decompressed size is not known,
      but its maximum possible value is guaranteed (see below).

   Reserved:  This is not a block.  This value cannot be used with the
      current specification.  If such a value is present, it is
      considered to be corrupt data.

<span class="h6"><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1.1.2.3">3.1.1.2.3</a>.  Block_Size</span>

   The upper 21 bits of Block_Header represent the Block_Size.
   Block_Size is the size of the block excluding the header.  A block
   can contain any number of bytes (even zero), up to
   Block_Maximum_Decompressed_Size, which is the smallest of:

   o  Window_Size

   o  128 KB

   A Compressed_Block has the extra restriction that Block_Size is
   always strictly less than the decompressed size.  If this condition
   cannot be respected, the block must be sent uncompressed instead
   (i.e., treated as a Raw_Block).

<span class="h5"><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1.1.3">3.1.1.3</a>.  Compressed Blocks</span>

   To decompress a compressed block, the compressed size must be
   provided from the Block_Size field within Block_Header.

   A compressed block consists of two sections: a Literals
   Section (<a href="#section-3.1.1.3.1">Section 3.1.1.3.1</a>) and a
   Sequences_Section (<a href="#section-3.1.1.3.2">Section 3.1.1.3.2</a>).  The results of the two
   sections are then combined to produce the decompressed data in
   Sequence Execution (<a href="#section-3.1.1.4">Section 3.1.1.4</a>).

   To decode a compressed block, the following elements are necessary:

   o  Previous decoded data, up to a distance of Window_Size, or the
      beginning of the Frame, whichever is smaller.  Single_Segment_Flag
      will be set in the latter case.

   o  List of "recent offsets" from the previous Compressed_Block.

   o  The previous Huffman tree, required by Treeless_Literals_Block
      type.

   o  Previous Finite State Entropy (FSE) decoding tables, required by
      Repeat_Mode, for each symbol type (literals lengths, match
      lengths, offsets).

   Note that decoding tables are not always from the previous
   Compressed_Block:

   o  Every decoding table can come from a dictionary.

   o  The Huffman tree comes from the previous
      Compressed_Literals_Block.

<span class="h6"><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1.1.3.1">3.1.1.3.1</a>.  Literals_Section_Header</span>

   All literals are regrouped in the first part of the block.  They can
   be decoded first and then copied during Sequence Execution (see
   <a href="#section-3.1.1.4">Section 3.1.1.4</a>), or they can be decoded on the flow during Sequence
   Execution.

   Literals can be stored uncompressed or compressed using Huffman
   prefix codes.  When compressed, an optional tree description can be
   present, followed by 1 or 4 streams.

<span class="h6"><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1.1.3.1.1">3.1.1.3.1.1</a>.  Literals_Section_Header</span>

   This field describes how literals are packed.  It's a byte-aligned
   variable-size bit field, ranging from 1 to 5 bytes, using little-
   endian convention.

     +---------------------+-----------+
     | Literals_Block_Type |  2 bits   |

     +---------------------+-----------+
     |  [Compressed_Size]  | 0-18 bits |
     +---------------------+-----------+

   In this representation, bits at the top are the lowest bits.

   The Literals_Block_Type field uses the two lowest bits of the first
   byte, describing four different block types:

     +---------------------------+-------+
     |    Literals_Block_Type    | Value |
     +---------------------------+-------+
     |     Raw_Literals_Block    |   0   |
     +---------------------------+-------+
     |     RLE_Literals_Block    |   1   |
     +---------------------------+-------+
     | Compressed_Literals_Block |   2   |
     +---------------------------+-------+
     |  Treeless_Literals_Block  |   3   |
     +---------------------------+-------+

   Raw_Literals_Block:  Literals are stored uncompressed.
      Literals_Section_Content is Regenerated_Size.

   RLE_Literals_Block:  Literals consist of a single-byte value repeated
      Regenerated_Size times.  Literals_Section_Content is 1.

   Compressed_Literals_Block:  This is a standard Huffman-compressed
      block, starting with a Huffman tree description.  See details
      below.  Literals_Section_Content is Compressed_Size.

   Treeless_Literals_Block:  This is a Huffman-compressed block, using
      the Huffman tree from the previous Compressed_Literals_Block, or a
      dictionary if there is no previous Huffman-compressed literals
      block.  Huffman_Tree_Description will be skipped.  Note that if
      this mode is triggered without any previous Huffman-table in the
      frame (or dictionary, per <a href="#section-5">Section 5</a>), it should be treated as data
      corruption.  Literals_Section_Content is Compressed_Size.

   The Size_Format is divided into two families:

   o  For Raw_Literals_Block and RLE_Literals_Block, it's only necessary
      to decode Regenerated_Size.  There is no Compressed_Size field.

   o  For Compressed_Block and Treeless_Literals_Block, it's required to
      decode both Compressed_Size and Regenerated_Size (the decompressed
      size).  It's also necessary to decode the number of streams (1 or
      4).

   For values spanning several bytes, the convention is little endian.

   Size_Format for Raw_Literals_Block and RLE_Literals_Block uses 1 or 2
   bits.  Its value is (Literals_Section_Header[0]&gt;&gt;2) &amp; 0x3.

   Size_Format == 00 or 10:  Size_Format uses 1 bit.  Regenerated_Size
      uses 5 bits (value 0-31).  Literals_Section_Header uses 1 byte.
      Regenerated_Size = Literal_Section_Header[0]&gt;&gt;3.

   Size_Format == 01:  Size_Format uses 2 bits.  Regenerated_Size uses
      12 bits (values 0-4095).  Literals_Section_Header uses 2 bytes.
      Regenerated_Size = (Literals_Section_Header[0]&gt;&gt;4) +
      (Literals_Section_Header[1]&lt;&lt;4).

   Size_Format == 11:  Size_Format uses 2 bits.  Regenerated_Size uses
      20 bits (values 0-1048575).  Literals_Section_Header uses 3 bytes.
      Regenerated_Size = (Literals_Section_Header[0]&gt;&gt;4) +
      (Literals_Section_Header[1]&lt;&lt;4) + (Literals_Section_Header[2]&lt;&lt;12)

   Only Stream_1 is present for these cases.  Note that it is permitted
   to represent a short value (for example, 13) using a long format,
   even if it's less efficient.

   Size_Format for Compressed_Literals_Block and Treeless_Literals_Block
   always uses 2 bits.

   Size_Format == 00:  A single stream.  Both Regenerated_Size and
      Compressed_Size use 10 bits (values 0-1023).
      Literals_Section_Header uses 3 bytes.

   Size_Format == 01:  4 streams.  Both Regenerated_Size and
      Compressed_Size use 10 bits (values 0-1023).
      Literals_Section_Header uses 3 bytes.

   Size_Format == 10:  4 streams.  Both Regenerated_Size and
      Compressed_Size use 14 bits (values 0-16383).
      Literals_Section_Header uses 4 bytes.

   Size_Format == 11:  4 streams.  Both Regenerated_Size and
      Compressed_Size use 18 bits (values 0-262143).
      Literals_Section_Header uses 5 bytes.

   Both the Compressed_Size and Regenerated_Size fields follow little-
   endian convention.  Note that Compressed_Size includes the size of
   the Huffman_Tree_Description when it is present.

<span class="h6"><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1.1.3.1.2">3.1.1.3.1.2</a>.  Raw_Literals_Block</span>

<span class="h6"><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1.1.3.1.3">3.1.1.3.1.3</a>.  RLE_Literals_Block</span>

   Stream_1 consists of a single byte that should be repeated
   Regenerated_Size times to generate the decoded literals.

<span class="h6"><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1.1.3.1.4">3.1.1.3.1.4</a>.  Compressed_Literals_Block and Treeless_Literals_Block</span>

   Both of these modes contain Huffman-encoded data.  For
   Treeless_Literals_Block, the Huffman table comes from the previously
   compressed literals block, or from a dictionary; see <a href="#section-5">Section 5</a>.

<span class="h6"><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1.1.3.1.5">3.1.1.3.1.5</a>.  Huffman_Tree_Description</span>

   This section is only present when the Literals_Block_Type type is
   Compressed_Literals_Block (2).  The format of
   Huffman_Tree_Description can be found in <a href="#section-4.2.1">Section 4.2.1</a>.  The size of
   Huffman_Tree_Description is determined during the decoding process.
   It must be used to determine where streams begin.

     Total_Streams_Size = Compressed_Size
                          - Huffman_Tree_Description_Size

<span class="h6"><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1.1.3.1.6">3.1.1.3.1.6</a>.  Jump_Table</span>

   The Jump_Table is only present when there are 4 Huffman-coded
   streams.

   (Reminder: Huffman-compressed data consists of either 1 or 4 Huffman-
   coded streams.)

   If only 1 stream is present, it is a single bitstream occupying the
   entire remaining portion of the literals block, encoded as described
   within <a href="#section-4.2.2">Section 4.2.2</a>.

   If there are 4 streams, Literals_Section_Header only provides enough
   information to know the decompressed and compressed sizes of all 4
   streams combined.  The decompressed size of each stream is equal to
   (Regenerated_Size+3)/4, except for the last stream, which may be up
   to 3 bytes smaller, to reach a total decompressed size as specified
   in Regenerated_Size.

   The compressed size of each stream is provided explicitly in the
   Jump_Table.  The Jump_Table is 6 bytes long and consists of three
   2-byte little-endian fields, describing the compressed sizes of the
   first 3 streams.  Stream4_Size is computed from Total_Streams_Size
   minus sizes of other streams.

     Stream4_Size = Total_Streams_Size - 6
                    - Stream1_Size - Stream2_Size
                    - Stream3_Size

   Note that if Stream1_Size + Stream2_Size + Stream3_Size exceeds
   Total_Streams_Size, the data are considered corrupted.

   Each of these 4 bitstreams is then decoded independently as a
   Huffman-Coded stream, as described in <a href="#section-4.2.2">Section 4.2.2</a>.

<span class="h6"><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1.1.3.2">3.1.1.3.2</a>.  Sequences_Section</span>

   A compressed block is a succession of sequences.  A sequence is a
   literal copy command, followed by a match copy command.  A literal
   copy command specifies a length.  It is the number of bytes to be
   copied (or extracted) from the Literals Section.  A match copy
   command specifies an offset and a length.

   When all sequences are decoded, if there are literals left in the
   literals section, these bytes are added at the end of the block.

   This is described in more detail in <a href="#section-3.1.1.4">Section 3.1.1.4</a>.

   The Sequences_Section regroups all symbols required to decode
   commands.  There are three symbol types: literals lengths, offsets,
   and match lengths.  They are encoded together, interleaved, in a
   single "bitstream".

   The Sequences_Section starts by a header, followed by optional
   probability tables for each symbol type, followed by the bitstream.

     Sequences_Section_Header
       [Literals_Length_Table]
       [Offset_Table]
       [Match_Length_Table]
       bitStream

   To decode the Sequences_Section, it's necessary to know its size.
   This size is deduced from the size of the Literals_Section:
   Sequences_Section_Size = Block_Size - Literals_Section_Header -
   Literals_Section_Content

<span class="h6"><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1.1.3.2.1">3.1.1.3.2.1</a>.  Sequences_Section_Header</span>

   This header consists of two items:

   o  Number_of_Sequences

   o  Symbol_Compression_Modes

   Number_of_Sequences is a variable size field using between 1 and 3
   bytes.  If the first byte is "byte0":

   o  if (byte0 == 0): there are no sequences.  The sequence section
      stops here.  Decompressed content is defined entirely as Literals
      Section content.  The FSE tables used in Repeat_Mode are not
      updated.

   o  if (byte0 &lt; 128): Number_of_Sequences = byte0.  Uses 1 byte.

   o  if (byte0 &lt; 255): Number_of_Sequences = ((byte0 - 128) &lt;&lt; 8) +
      byte1.  Uses 2 bytes.

   o  if (byte0 == 255): Number_of_Sequences = byte1 + (byte2 &lt;&lt; 8) +
      0x7F00.  Uses 3 bytes.

   Symbol_Compression_Modes is a single byte, defining the compression
   mode of each symbol type.

     +-------------+----------------------+
     | Bit Number  |      Field Name      |
     +-------------+----------------------+
     |     7-6     | Literal_Lengths_Mode |

     +-------------+----------------------+
     |     1-0     |       Reserved       |
     +-------------+----------------------+

   The last field, Reserved, must be all zeroes.

   Literals_Lengths_Mode, Offsets_Mode, and Match_Lengths_Mode define
   the Compression_Mode of literals lengths, offsets, and match lengths
   symbols, respectively.  They follow the same enumeration:

     +-------+---------------------+
     | Value |  Compression_Mode   |
     +-------+---------------------+
     |   0   |   Predefined_Mode   |
     +-------+---------------------+
     |   1   |      RLE_Mode       |
     +-------+---------------------+
     |   2   | FSE_Compressed_Mode |
     +-------+---------------------+
     |   3   |     Repeat_Mode     |
     +-------+---------------------+

   Predefined_Mode:  A predefined FSE (see <a href="#section-4.1">Section 4.1</a>) distribution
      table is used, as defined in <a href="#section-3.1.1.3.2.2">Section 3.1.1.3.2.2</a>.  No distribution
      table will be present.

   RLE_Mode:  The table description consists of a single byte, which
      contains the symbol's value.  This symbol will be used for all
      sequences.

   FSE_Compressed_Mode:  Standard FSE compression.  A distribution table
      will be present.  The format of this distribution table is
      described in <a href="#section-4.1.1">Section 4.1.1</a>.  Note that the maximum allowed
      accuracy log for literals length and match length tables is 9, and
      the maximum accuracy log for the offsets table is 8.  This mode
      must not be used when only one symbol is present; RLE_Mode should
      be used instead (although any other mode will work).

   Repeat_Mode:  The table used in the previous Compressed_Block with
      Number_Of_Sequences &gt; 0 will be used again, or if this is the
      first block, the table in the dictionary will be used.  Note that
      this includes RLE_Mode, so if Repeat_Mode follows RLE_Mode, the
      same symbol will be repeated.  It also includes Predefined_Mode,
      in which case Repeat_Mode will have the same outcome as
      Predefined_Mode.  No distribution table will be present.  If this
      mode is used without any previous sequence table in the frame (or
      dictionary; see <a href="#section-5">Section 5</a>) to repeat, this should be treated as
      corruption.

   Each symbol is a code in its own context, which specifies Baseline
   and Number_of_Bits to add.  Codes are FSE compressed and interleaved
   with raw additional bits in the same bitstream.

   Literals length codes are values ranging from 0 to 35 inclusive.
   They define lengths from 0 to 131071 bytes.  The literals length is
   equal to the decoded Baseline plus the result of reading
   Number_of_Bits bits from the bitstream, as a little-endian value.

   Offset codes are values ranging from 0 to N.

   A decoder is free to limit its maximum supported value for N.
   Support for values of at least 22 is recommended.  At the time of
   this writing, the reference decoder supports a maximum N value of 31.

   An offset code is also the number of additional bits to read in
   little-endian fashion and can be translated into an Offset_Value
   using the following formulas:

     Offset_Value = (1 &lt;&lt; offsetCode) + readNBits(offsetCode);
     if (Offset_Value &gt; 3) Offset = Offset_Value - 3;

   This means that maximum Offset_Value is (2^(N+1))-1, supporting back-
   reference distance up to (2^(N+1))-4, but it is limited by the
   maximum back-reference distance (see <a href="#section-3.1.1.1.2">Section 3.1.1.1.2</a>).

   Offset_Value from 1 to 3 are special: they define "repeat codes".
   This is described in more detail in <a href="#section-3.1.1.5">Section 3.1.1.5</a>.

<span class="h6"><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1.1.3.2.1.2">3.1.1.3.2.1.2</a>.  Decoding Sequences</span>

   FSE bitstreams are read in reverse of the direction they are written.
   In zstd, the compressor writes bits forward into a block, and the
   decompressor must read the bitstream backwards.

   To find the start of the bitstream, it is therefore necessary to know
   the offset of the last byte of the block, which can be found by
   counting Block_Size bytes after the block header.

   After writing the last bit containing information, the compressor
   writes a single 1 bit and then fills the byte with 0-7 zero bits of
   padding.  The last byte of the compressed bitstream cannot be zero
   for that reason.

   When decompressing, the last byte containing the padding is the first
   byte to read.  The decompressor needs to skip 0-7 initial zero bits
   until the first 1 bit occurs.  Afterwards, the useful part of the
   bitstream begins.

   FSE decoding requires a 'state' to be carried from symbol to symbol.
   For more explanation on FSE decoding, see <a href="#section-4.1">Section 4.1</a>.

   For sequence decoding, a separate state keeps track of each literal
   lengths, offsets, and match lengths symbols.  Some FSE primitives are
   also used.  For more details on the operation of these primitives,
   see <a href="#section-4.1">Section 4.1</a>.

   The bitstream starts with initial FSE state values, each using the
   required number of bits in their respective accuracy, decoded
   previously from their normalized distribution.  It starts with
   Literals_Length_State, followed by Offset_State, and finally
   Match_Length_State.

   Note that all values are read backward, so the 'start' of the
   bitstream is at the highest position in memory, immediately before
   the last 1 bit for padding.

   After decoding the starting states, a single sequence is decoded
   Number_Of_Sequences times.  These sequences are decoded in order from
   first to last.  Since the compressor writes the bitstream in the
   forward direction, this means the compressor must encode the
   sequences starting with the last one and ending with the first.

   For each of the symbol types, the FSE state can be used to determine
   the appropriate code.  The code then defines the Baseline and
   Number_of_Bits to read for each type.  The description of the codes
   for how to determine these values can be found in
   <a href="#section-3.1.1.3.2.1">Section 3.1.1.3.2.1</a>.

   Decoding starts by reading the Number_of_Bits required to decode
   offset.  It does the same for Match_Length and then for
   Literals_Length.  This sequence is then used for Sequence Execution
   (see <a href="#section-3.1.1.4">Section 3.1.1.4</a>).

   If it is not the last sequence in the block, the next operation is to
   update states.  Using the rules pre-calculated in the decoding
   tables, Literals_Length_State is updated, followed by
   Match_Length_State, and then Offset_State.  See <a href="#section-4.1">Section 4.1</a> for
   details on how to update states from the bitstream.

   This operation will be repeated Number_of_Sequences times.  At the
   end, the bitstream shall be entirely consumed; otherwise, the
   bitstream is considered corrupted.

<span class="h6"><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1.1.3.2.2.3">3.1.1.3.2.2.3</a>.  Offset Codes</span>

   The decoding table uses an accuracy log of 5 bits (32 states), and

   If any sequence in the compressed block requires a larger offset than
   this, it's not possible to use the default distribution to represent

<span class="h5"><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1.1.4">3.1.1.4</a>.  Sequence Execution</span>

   Once literals and sequences have been decoded, they are combined to
   produce the decoded content of a block.

   Each sequence consists of a tuple of (literals_length, offset_value,
   match_length), decoded as described in the
   Sequences_Section (<a href="#section-3.1.1.3.2">Section 3.1.1.3.2</a>).  To execute a sequence, first
   copy literals_length bytes from the decoded literals to the output.

   Then, match_length bytes are copied from previous decoded data.  The
   offset to copy from is determined by offset_value:

   o  if Offset_Value &gt; 3, then the offset is Offset_Value - 3;

   o  if Offset_Value is from 1-3, the offset is a special repeat offset
      value.  See <a href="#section-3.1.1.5">Section 3.1.1.5</a> for how the offset is determined in
      this case.

   The offset is defined as from the current position (after copying the
   literals), so an offset of 6 and a match length of 3 means that 3
   bytes should be copied from 6 bytes back.  Note that all offsets
   leading to previously decoded data must be smaller than Window_Size
   defined in Frame_Header_Descriptor (<a href="#section-3.1.1.1.1">Section 3.1.1.1.1</a>).

<span class="h5"><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1.1.5">3.1.1.5</a>.  Repeat Offsets</span>

   As seen above, the first three values define a repeated offset; we
   will call them Repeated_Offset1, Repeated_Offset2, and
   Repeated_Offset3.  They are sorted in recency order, with
   Repeated_Offset1 meaning "most recent one".

   If offset_value is 1, then the offset used is Repeated_Offset1, etc.

   There is one exception: When the current sequence's literals_length
   is 0, repeated offsets are shifted by 1, so an offset_value of 1
   means Repeated_Offset2, an offset_value of 2 means Repeated_Offset3,
   and an offset_value of 3 means Repeated_Offset1 - 1_byte.

   For the first block, the starting offset history is populated with
   the following values: Repeated_Offset1 (1), Repeated_Offset2 (4), and
   Repeated_Offset3 (8), unless a dictionary is used, in which case they
   come from the dictionary.

   Then each block gets its starting offset history from the ending
   values of the most recent Compressed_Block.  Note that blocks that
   are not Compressed_Block are skipped; they do not contribute to
   offset history.

   The newest offset takes the lead in offset history, shifting others
   back (up to its previous place if it was already present).  This
   means that when Repeated_Offset1 (most recent) is used, history is
   unmodified.  When Repeated_Offset2 is used, it is swapped with
   Repeated_Offset1.  If any other offset is used, it becomes
   Repeated_Offset1, and the rest are shifted back by 1.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1.2">3.1.2</a>.  Skippable Frames</span>

     +--------------+------------+-----------+
     |    4 bytes   |   4 bytes  |  n bytes  |
     +--------------+------------+-----------+

   Skippable frames allow the insertion of user-defined metadata into a
   flow of concatenated frames.

   Skippable frames defined in this specification are compatible with
   skippable frames in [<a href="#ref-LZ4" title="&quot;LZ4 Frame Format Description&quot;">LZ4</a>].

   From a compliant decoder perspective, skippable frames simply need to
   be skipped, and their content ignored, resuming decoding after the
   skippable frame.

   It should be noted that a skippable frame can be used to watermark a
   stream of concatenated frames embedding any kind of tracking
   information (even just a Universally Unique Identifier (UUID)).
   Users wary of such possibility should scan the stream of concatenated
   frames in an attempt to detect such frames for analysis or removal.

   The fields are:

   Magic_Number:  4 bytes, little-endian format.  Value: 0x184D2A5?,
      which means any value from 0x184D2A50 to 0x184D2A5F.  All 16
      values are valid to identify a skippable frame.  This
      specification does not detail any specific tagging methods for
      skippable frames.

   Frame_Size:  This is the size, in bytes, of the following User_Data
      (without including the magic number nor the size field itself).
      This field is represented using 4 bytes, little-endian format,
      unsigned 32 bits.  This means User_Data can't be bigger than
      (2^32-1) bytes.

   User_Data:  This field can be anything.  Data will just be skipped by
      the decoder.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" href="#section-4">4</a>.  Entropy Encoding</span>

   Two types of entropy encoding are used by the Zstandard format: FSE
   and Huffman coding.  Huffman is used to compress literals, while FSE
   is used for all other symbols (Literals_Length_Code,
   Match_Length_Code, and offset codes) and to compress Huffman headers.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.1">4.1</a>.  FSE</span>

   FSE, short for Finite State Entropy, is an entropy codec based on
   [<a href="#ref-ANS" title="&quot;Asymmetric numeral systems: entropy coding combining speed of Huffman coding with compression rate of arithmetic coding&quot;">ANS</a>].  FSE encoding/decoding involves a state that is carried over
   between symbols, so decoding must be done in the opposite direction
   as encoding.  Therefore, all FSE bitstreams are read from end to
   beginning.  Note that the order of the bits in the stream is not
   reversed; they are simply read in the reverse order from which they
   were written.

   For additional details on FSE, see Finite State Entropy [<a href="#ref-FSE" title="&quot;FiniteStateEntropy&quot;">FSE</a>].

   FSE decoding involves a decoding table that has a power of 2 size and
   contains three elements: Symbol, Num_Bits, and Baseline.  The base 2
   logarithm of the table size is its Accuracy_Log.  An FSE state value
   represents an index in this table.

   To obtain the initial state value, consume Accuracy_Log bits from the
   stream as a little-endian value.  The next symbol in the stream is
   the Symbol indicated in the table for that state.  To obtain the next
   state value, the decoder should consume Num_Bits bits from the stream
   as a little-endian value and add it to Baseline.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.1.1">4.1.1</a>.  FSE Table Description</span>

   To decode FSE streams, it is necessary to construct the decoding
   table.  The Zstandard format encodes FSE table descriptions as
   described here.

   An FSE distribution table describes the probabilities of all symbols
   from 0 to the last present one (included) on a normalized scale of
   (1 &lt;&lt; Accuracy_Log).  Note that there must be two or more symbols
   with non-zero probability.

   A bitstream is read forward, in little-endian fashion.  It is not
   necessary to know its exact size, since the size will be discovered
   and reported by the decoding process.  The bitstream starts by
   reporting on which scale it operates.  If low4bits designates the
   lowest 4 bits of the first byte, then Accuracy_Log = low4bits + 5.












<span class="grey">Collet &amp; Kucherawy            Informational                    [Page 31]</span></pre>
<hr class="noprint" style="margin-left:0;margin-right:auto;text-align:left;" /><pre class="newpage"><a href="#page-32" class="invisible"> </a>

   This is followed by each symbol value, from 0 to the last present
   one.  The number of bits used by each field is variable and depends
   on:

   Remaining probabilities + 1:  For example, presuming an Accuracy_Log
      of 8, and presuming 100 probabilities points have already been
      distributed, the decoder may read any value from 0 to
      (256 - 100 + 1) == 157, inclusive.  Therefore, it must read
      log2sup(157) == 8 bits.

   Value decoded:  Small values use 1 fewer bit.  For example, presuming
      values from 0 to 157 (inclusive) are possible, 255 - 157 = 98
      values are remaining in an 8-bit field.  The first 98 values
      (hence from 0 to 97) use only 7 bits, and values from 98 to 157
      use 8 bits.  This is achieved through this scheme:

     +------------+---------------+-----------+
     | Value Read | Value Decoded | Bits Used |
     +------------+---------------+-----------+
     |   0 - 97   |     0 - 97    |     7     |
     +------------+---------------+-----------+
     |  98 - 127  |    98 - 127   |     8     |
     +------------+---------------+-----------+
     | 128 - 225  |     0 - 97    |     7     |
     +------------+---------------+-----------+
     | 226 - 255  |   128 - 157   |     8     |
     +------------+---------------+-----------+

   Symbol probabilities are read one by one, in order.  The probability
   is obtained from Value decoded using the formula P = Value - 1.  This
   means the value 0 becomes the negative probability -1.  This is a
   special probability that means "less than 1".  Its effect on the
   distribution table is described below.  For the purpose of
   calculating total allocated probability points, it counts as 1.

   When a symbol has a probability of zero, it is followed by a 2-bit
   repeat flag.  This repeat flag tells how many probabilities of zeroes
   follow the current one.  It provides a number ranging from 0 to 3.
   If it is a 3, another 2-bit repeat flag follows, and so on.

   When the last symbol reaches a cumulated total of
   (1 &lt;&lt; Accuracy_Log), decoding is complete.  If the last symbol makes
   the cumulated total go above (1 &lt;&lt; Accuracy_Log), distribution is
   considered corrupted.







<span class="grey">Collet &amp; Kucherawy            Informational                    [Page 32]</span></pre>

   Finally, the decoder can tell how many bytes were used in this
   process and how many symbols are present.  The bitstream consumes a
   round number of bytes.  Any remaining bit within the last byte is
   simply unused.

   The distribution of normalized probabilities is enough to create a
   unique decoding table.  The table has a size of (1 &lt;&lt; Accuracy_Log).
   Each cell describes the symbol decoded and instructions to get the
   next state.

   Symbols are scanned in their natural order for "less than 1"
   probabilities as described above.  Symbols with this probability are
   being attributed a single cell, starting from the end of the table
   and retreating.  These symbols define a full state reset, reading
   Accuracy_Log bits.

   All remaining symbols are allocated in their natural order.  Starting
   from symbol 0 and table position 0, each symbol gets allocated as
   many cells as its probability.  Cell allocation is spread, not
   linear; each successor position follows this rule:

     position += (tableSize &gt;&gt; 1) + (tableSize &gt;&gt; 3) + 3;
     position &amp;= tableSize - 1;

   A position is skipped if it is already occupied by a "less than 1"
   probability symbol.  Position does not reset between symbols; it
   simply iterates through each position in the table, switching to the
   next symbol when enough states have been allocated to the current
   one.

   The result is a list of state values.  Each state will decode the
   current symbol.

   To get the Number_of_Bits and Baseline required for the next state,
   it is first necessary to sort all states in their natural order.  The
   lower states will need 1 more bit than higher ones.  The process is
   repeated for each symbol.

   For example, presuming a symbol has a probability of 5, it receives
   five state values.  States are sorted in natural order.  The next
   power of 2 is 8.  The space of probabilities is divided into 8 equal
   parts.  Presuming the Accuracy_Log is 7, this defines 128 states, and
   each share (divided by 8) is 16 in size.  In order to reach 8, 8 - 5
   = 3 lowest states will count "double", doubling the number of shares
   (32 in width), requiring 1 more bit in the process.

   Baseline is assigned starting from the higher states using fewer
   bits, and proceeding naturally, then resuming at the first state,
   each taking its allocated width from Baseline.

     +----------------+-------+-------+--------+------+-------+
     |   state order  |   0   |   1   |   2    |  3   |  4    |

   The next state is determined from the current state by reading the
   required Number_of_Bits and adding the specified Baseline.

   the default distributions.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.2">4.2</a>.  Huffman Coding</span>

   Zstandard Huffman-coded streams are read backwards, similar to the
   FSE bitstreams.  Therefore, to find the start of the bitstream, it is
   necessary to know the offset of the last byte of the Huffman-coded
   stream.

   After writing the last bit containing information, the compressor
   writes a single 1 bit and then fills the byte with 0-7 0 bits of
   padding.  The last byte of the compressed bitstream cannot be 0 for
   that reason.

   When decompressing, the last byte containing the padding is the first
   byte to read.  The decompressor needs to skip 0-7 initial 0 bits and
   the first 1 bit that occurs.  Afterwards, the useful part of the
   bitstream begins.

   The bitstream contains Huffman-coded symbols in little-endian order,
   with the codes defined by the method below.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.2.1">4.2.1</a>.  Huffman Tree Description</span>

   Prefix coding represents symbols from an a priori known alphabet by
   bit sequences (codewords), one codeword for each symbol, in a manner
   such that different symbols may be represented by bit sequences of
   different lengths, but a parser can always parse an encoded string
   unambiguously symbol by symbol.

   Given an alphabet with known symbol frequencies, the Huffman
   algorithm allows the construction of an optimal prefix code using the
   fewest bits of any possible prefix codes for that alphabet.

   The prefix code must not exceed a maximum code length.  More bits
   improve accuracy but yield a larger header size and require more
   memory or more complex decoding operations.  This specification
   limits the maximum code length to 11 bits.

   All literal values from zero (included) to the last present one
   (excluded) are represented by Weight with values from 0 to
   Max_Number_of_Bits.  Transformation from Weight to Number_of_Bits
   follows this pseudocode:

     if Weight == 0
       Number_of_Bits = 0
     else
       Number_of_Bits = Max_Number_of_Bits + 1 - Weight

   The last symbol's Weight is deduced from previously decoded ones, by
   completing to the nearest power of 2.  This power of 2 gives
   Max_Number_of_Bits the depth of the current tree.

   For example, presume the following Huffman tree must be described:

     +---------------+----------------+
     | Literal Value | Number_of_Bits |
     +---------------+----------------+
     |       0       |        1       |
     +---------------+----------------+
     |       1       |        2       |
     +---------------+----------------+
     |       2       |        3       |
     +---------------+----------------+
     |       3       |        0       |
     +---------------+----------------+
     |       4       |        4       |
     +---------------+----------------+
     |       5       |        4       |

   The tree depth is 4, since its longest element uses 4 bits.  (The
   longest elements are those with the smallest frequencies.)  Value 5
   will not be listed as it can be determined from the values for 0-4,
   nor will values above 5 as they are all 0.  Values from 0 to 4 will
   be listed using Weight instead of Number_of_Bits.  The pseudocode to
   determine Weight is:

     if Number_of_Bits == 0
       Weight = 0
     else
       Weight = Max_Number_of_Bits + 1 - Number_of_Bits

   It gives the following series of weights:

     +---------------+--------+
     | Literal Value | Weight |
     +---------------+--------+
     |       0       |   4    |
     +---------------+--------+
     |       1       |   3    |
     +---------------+--------+
     |       2       |   2    |
     +---------------+--------+
     |       3       |   0    |
     +---------------+--------+
     |       4       |   1    |
     +---------------+--------+

   The decoder will do the inverse operation: having collected weights
   of literals from 0 to 4, it knows the last literal, 5, is present
   with a non-zero Weight.  The Weight of 5 can be determined by
   advancing to the next power of 2.  The sum of 2^(Weight-1) (excluding
   0's) is 15.  The nearest power of 2 is 16.  Therefore,
   Max_Number_of_Bits = 4 and Weight[5] = 16 - 15 = 1.

<span class="h5"><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.2.1.1">4.2.1.1</a>.  Huffman Tree Header</span>

   This is a single byte value (0-255), which describes how the series
   of weights is encoded.

   headerByte &lt; 128:  The series of weights is compressed using FSE (see
      below).  The length of the FSE-compressed series is equal to
      headerByte (0-127).

   headerByte &gt;= 128:  This is a direct representation, where each
      Weight is written directly as a 4-bit field (0-15).  They are
      encoded forward, 2 weights to a byte with the first weight taking
      the top 4 bits and the second taking the bottom 4; for example,
      the following operations could be used to read the weights:

     Weight[0] = (Byte[0] &gt;&gt; 4)
     Weight[1] = (Byte[0] &amp; 0xf),
     etc.

      The full representation occupies ceiling(Number_of_Symbols/2)
      bytes, meaning it uses only full bytes even if Number_of_Symbols
      is odd.  Number_of_Symbols = headerByte - 127.  Note that maximum
      Number_of_Symbols is 255 - 127 = 128.  If any literal has a value
      over 128, raw header mode is not possible, and it is necessary to
      use FSE compression.

<span class="h5"><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.2.1.2">4.2.1.2</a>.  FSE Compression of Huffman Weights</span>

   In this case, the series of Huffman weights is compressed using FSE
   compression.  It is a single bitstream with two interleaved states,
   sharing a single distribution table.

   To decode an FSE bitstream, it is necessary to know its compressed
   size.  Compressed size is provided by headerByte.  It's also
   necessary to know its maximum possible decompressed size, which is
   255, since literal values span from 0 to 255, and the last symbol's
   Weight is not represented.

   An FSE bitstream starts by a header, describing probabilities
   distribution.  It will create a decoding table.  For a list of
   Huffman weights, the maximum accuracy log is 6 bits.  For more
   details, see <a href="#section-4.1.1">Section 4.1.1</a>.

   The Huffman header compression uses two states, which share the same
   FSE distribution table.  The first state (State1) encodes the even-
   numbered index symbols, and the second (State2) encodes the odd-
   numbered index symbols.  State1 is initialized first, and then
   State2, and they take turns decoding a single symbol and updating
   their state.  For more details on these FSE operations, see
   <a href="#section-4.1">Section 4.1</a>.

   The number of symbols to be decoded is determined by tracking the
   bitStream overflow condition: If updating state after decoding a
   symbol would require more bits than remain in the stream, it is
   assumed that extra bits are zero.  Then, symbols for each of the
   final states are decoded and the process is complete.

<span class="h5"><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.2.1.3">4.2.1.3</a>.  Conversion from Weights to Huffman Prefix Codes</span>

   All present symbols will now have a Weight value.  It is possible to
   transform weights into Number_of_Bits, using this formula:

     if Weight &gt; 0
         Number_of_Bits = Max_Number_of_Bits + 1 - Weight
     else
         Number_of_Bits = 0

   Symbols are sorted by Weight.  Within the same Weight, symbols keep
   natural sequential order.  Symbols with a Weight of zero are removed.
   Then, starting from the lowest Weight, prefix codes are distributed
   in sequential order.

   For example, assume the following list of weights has been decoded:

     +---------+--------+
     | Literal | Weight |
     +---------+--------+
     |    0    |   4    |
     +---------+--------+
     |    1    |   3    |

     |    3    |   0    |
     +---------+--------+
     |    4    |   1    |

   Sorting by weight and then the natural sequential order yields the
   following distribution:

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.2.2">4.2.2</a>.  Huffman-Coded Streams</span>

   Given a Huffman decoding table, it is possible to decode a Huffman-
   coded stream.

   Each bitstream must be read backward, which starts from the end and
   goes up to the beginning.  Therefore, it is necessary to know the
   size of each bitstream.

   It is also necessary to know exactly which bit is the last.  This is
   detected by a final bit flag: the highest bit of the last byte is a
   final-bit-flag.  Consequently, a last byte of 0 is not possible.  And
   the final-bit-flag itself is not part of the useful bitstream.
   Hence, the last byte contains between 0 and 7 useful bits.

   Starting from the end, it is possible to read the bitstream in a
   little-endian fashion, keeping track of already used bits.  Since the
   bitstream is encoded in reverse order, starting from the end, read
   symbols in forward order.













<span class="grey">Collet &amp; Kucherawy            Informational                    [Page 39]</span></pre>

   For example, if the literal sequence "0145" was encoded using the
   above prefix code, it would be encoded (in reverse order) as:

     +---------+----------+
     | Symbol  | Encoding |
     +---------+----------+
     |    5    |   0000   |
     +---------+----------+
     |    4    |   0001   |
     +---------+----------+
     |    1    |    01    |
     +---------+----------+
     |    0    |    1     |
     +---------+----------+
     | Padding |   00001  |
     +---------+----------+

   This results in the following 2-byte bitstream:

     00010000 00001101

   Here is an alternative representation with the symbol codes separated
   by underscores:

     0001_0000 00001_1_01

   Reading the highest Max_Number_of_Bits bits, it's possible to compare
   the extracted value to the decoding table, determining the symbol to
   decode and number of bits to discard.

   The process continues reading up to the required number of symbols
   per stream.  If a bitstream is not entirely and exactly consumed,
   hence reaching exactly its beginning position with all bits consumed,
   the decoding process is considered faulty.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" href="#section-5">5</a>.  Dictionary Format</span>

   Zstandard is compatible with "raw content" dictionaries, free of any
   format restriction, except that they must be at least 8 bytes.  These
   dictionaries function as if they were just the content part of a
   formatted dictionary.

   However, dictionaries created by "zstd --train" in the reference
   implementation follow a specific format, described here.

   Dictionaries are not included in the compressed content but rather
   are provided out of band.  That is, the Dictionary_ID identifies
   which should be used, but this specification does not describe the



<span class="grey">Collet &amp; Kucherawy            Informational                    [Page 40]</span></pre>

   mechanism by which the dictionary is obtained prior to use during
   compression or decompression.

   A dictionary has a size, defined either by a buffer limit or a file
   size.  The general format is:

     +--------------+---------------+----------------+---------+
     | Magic_Number | Dictionary_ID | Entropy_Tables | Content |
     +--------------+---------------+----------------+---------+

   Magic_Number:  4 bytes ID, value 0xEC30A437, little-endian format.

   Dictionary_ID:  4 bytes, stored in little-endian format.
      Dictionary_ID can be any value, except 0 (which means no
      Dictionary_ID).  It is used by decoders to check if they use the
      correct dictionary.  If the frame is going to be distributed in a
      private environment, any Dictionary_ID can be used.  However, for
      public distribution of compressed frames, the following ranges are
      reserved and shall not be used:

         low range: &lt;= 32767
         high range: &gt;= (2^31)

   Entropy_Tables:  Follow the same format as the tables in compressed
      blocks.  See the relevant FSE and Huffman sections for how to
      decode these tables.  They are stored in the following order:
      Huffman table for literals, FSE table for offsets, FSE table for
      match lengths, and FSE table for literals lengths.  These tables
      populate the Repeat Stats literals mode and Repeat distribution
      mode for sequence decoding.  It is finally followed by 3 offset
      values, populating repeat offsets (instead of using {1,4,8}),
      stored in order, 4-bytes little-endian each, for a total of 12
      bytes.  Each repeat offset must have a value less than the
      dictionary size.

   Content:  The rest of the dictionary is its content.  The content
      acts as a "past" in front of data to be compressed or
      decompressed, so it can be referenced in sequence commands.  As
      long as the amount of data decoded from this frame is less than or
      equal to Window_Size, sequence commands may specify offsets longer
      than the total length of decoded output so far to reference back
      to the dictionary, even parts of the dictionary with offsets
      larger than Window_Size.  After the total output has surpassed
      Window_Size, however, this is no longer allowed, and the
      dictionary is no longer accessible.

   Work in progress includes development of dictionaries that will
   optimize compression and decompression of particular types of data.
   Specification of such dictionaries for public use will necessitate
   registration of a code point from the reserved range described in
   <a href="#section-3.1.1.1.3">Section 3.1.1.1.3</a> and its association with a specific dictionary.

   However, there are at present no such dictionaries published for
   public use, so this document makes no immediate request of IANA to
   create such a registry.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" href="#section-7">7</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   Any data compression method involves the reduction of redundancy in
   the data.  Zstandard is no exception, and the usual precautions
   apply.

   One should never compress a message whose content must remain secret
   with a message generated by a third party.  Such a compression can be
   used to guess the content of the secret message through analysis of
   entropy reduction.  This was demonstrated in the Compression Ratio
   Info-leak Made Easy (CRIME) attack [<a href="#ref-CRIME" title="&quot;CRIME&quot;">CRIME</a>], for example.

   A decoder has to demonstrate capabilities to detect and prevent any
   kind of data tampering in the compressed frame from triggering system
   faults, such as reading or writing beyond allowed memory ranges.
   This can be guaranteed by either the implementation language or
   careful bound checkings.  Of particular note is the encoding of
   Number_of_Sequences values that cause the decoder to read into the
   block header (and beyond), as well as the indication of a
   Frame_Content_Size that is smaller than the actual decompressed data,
   in an attempt to trigger a buffer overflow.  It is highly recommended



<span class="grey">Collet &amp; Kucherawy            Informational                    [Page 43]</span></pre>

   to fuzz-test (i.e., provide invalid, unexpected, or random input and
   verify safe operation of) decoder implementations to test and harden
   their capability to detect bad frames and deal with them without any
   adverse system side effect.

   An attacker may provide correctly formed compressed frames with
   unreasonable memory requirements.  A decoder must always control
   memory requirements and enforce some (system-specific) limits in
   order to protect memory usage from such scenarios.

   Compression can be optimized by training a dictionary on a variety of
   related content payloads.  This dictionary must then be available at
   the decoder for decompression of the payload to be possible.  While
   this document does not specify how to acquire a dictionary for a
   given compressed payload, it is worth noting that third-party
   dictionaries may interact unexpectedly with a decoder, leading to
   possible memory or other resource exhaustion attacks.  We expect such
   topics to be discussed in further detail in the Security
   Considerations section of a forthcoming RFC for dictionary
   acquisition and transmission, but highlight this issue now out of an
   abundance of caution.

   As discussed in <a href="#section-3.1.2">Section 3.1.2</a>, it is possible to store arbitrary user
   metadata in skippable frames.  While such frames are ignored during
   decompression of the data, they can be used as a watermark to track
   the path of the compressed payload.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" href="#section-8">8</a>.  Implementation Status</span>

   Source code for a C language implementation of a Zstandard-compliant
   library is available at [<a href="#ref-ZSTD-GITHUB" title="&quot;zstd&quot;">ZSTD-GITHUB</a>].  This implementation is
   considered to be the reference implementation and is production
   ready; it implements the full range of the specification.  It is
   routinely tested against security hazards and widely deployed within
   Facebook infrastructure.

   The reference version is optimized for speed and is highly portable.
   It has been proven to run safely on multiple architectures (e.g.,
   x86, x64, ARM, MIPS, PowerPC, IA64) featuring 32- or 64-bit
   addressing schemes, a little- or big-endian storage scheme, a number
   of different operating systems (e.g., UNIX (including Linux, BSD,
   OS-X, and Solaris) and Windows), and a number of compilers (e.g.,
   gcc, clang, visual, and icc).

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-A">Appendix A</a>.  Decoding Tables for Predefined Codes</span>

   This appendix contains FSE decoding tables for the predefined literal
   length, match length, and offset codes.  The tables have been
   constructed using the algorithm as given above in <a href="#section-4.1.1">Section 4.1.1</a>.  The
   tables here can be used as examples to crosscheck that an
   implementation has built its decoding tables correctly.

            <h1><a class="anchor" href="#dbxfs"></a>dbxfs</h1> <p>dbxfs allows you to mount your Dropbox folder as if it were a local filesystem. It differs from the official Dropbox client in two main ways:</p> <ul><li>Internet connectivity is required for access</li> <li>No disk space is required for access</li> </ul><p>dbxfs has been tested on Linux and macOS but it should run on any POSIX system that provides a FUSE-compatible library or has the ability to mount SMB shares. Windows support is coming very soon. It runs on non-x86 architectures like ARM. It doesn't require a specific file system.</p> <p>It is written for Python 3.5+ and is licensed under the GPLv3.</p> <p>Disclaimer: dbxfs is not affiliated with Dropbox, Inc.</p> <h1><a class="anchor" href="#usage"></a>Usage</h1> <h2><a class="anchor" href="#optional-install-fuse"></a>(Optional) Install FUSE</h2> <p>macOS users can skip this. If you are on Linux, you must install your OS's FUSE library.

To do that you must edit the dbxfs config file. First you need to find the default config file location:</p> <pre><code>$ dbxfs --print-default-config-file </code></pre> <p>It is a JSON encoded file. Add the following JSON key to the top-level JSON object in that file:</p> <pre><code>"access_token_command": ["gpg", "--decrypt", "/path/to/access/token/file.gpg"] </code></pre> <p>Adapt it to a decryption program of your choice. This configuration works great for storing the access token using a OpenPGP card.</p> <h1><a class="anchor" href="#contact"></a>Contact</h1> <p>Rian Hunter <a href="https://twitter.com/cejetvole">@cejetvole</a></p>

<p>In addition to being talented, Darwin was lucky. Upon arriving in the Galapagos Islands in the Pacific Ocean, he found a rich variety of tortoises and birds living under unique environmental conditions, such as geographic isolation and diet, which must have strongly influenced their evolution over millions of years. The probable cause of the occurrence of so many animals that were so similar to each other – birds, for example, with shorter or longer bills, depending on what they eat – seemed clear. However, the entire world is not precisely similar to the Galapagos. Even if they study areas rich in biodiversity, such as the Atlantic Forest, biologists today do not always encounter evolutionary histories and closely related species that display such marked differences. Nevertheless, when working with specific strands of DNA sequences known as molecular markers, biologists can now identify the genetic bases of species diversification. A mechanism for the formation of new species that has been gaining recognition among researchers is the possibility of plant and animal species that are genetically similar to one other crossing naturally and generating fertile hybrids.</p>
<p>Previously, this idea was not widely accepted, because, in general, different species have different numbers of chromosomes, the structures within cells that contain genes. This difference can prevent the normal development of the embryo, as each chromosome that came from the male parent must be aligned with an equivalent chromosome from the female parent when the fertilized cell divides for the first time. Without this proper alignment, the cell usually cannot divide and, thus, dies. However, there are exceptions, and such exceptions appear to be less rare than was previously thought. The crossing between plants – or animals – of closely related species can produce offspring that, although of hybrid origin, are fertile, even though some chromosomes do not encounter their respective partner in the initial phases of cell division. With sufficient time and favorable environmental conditions, such hybridization events can generate species that are different from both of those from which they originated.</p>
<p>Today, the word “hybrid” defines the sterile mule, which is the result of a donkey crossing with a horse, but it also defines fertile organisms, such as the hybrid orchids from the Atlantic Forest that are maintained in a plant nursery at the Botanical Institute of São Paulo. This hybrid orchid has 38 chromosomes and resulted from a natural cross between two wild species, <em>Epidendrum fulgens</em>, which has 24 chromosomes, and <em>Epidendrum puniceolutem, </em>which contains 52 chromosomes. Externally, the differences between these two species are subtle: the flowers of the so-called parental species are red or yellow, whereas the flowers of the hybrid can be orange with red spots.</p>
<p>Genetic information alone is insufficient to identify fertile hybrids. Nevertheless, fertile hybrids are now identified with relative ease because, in addition to comparing the number of chromosomes, experts initially examine the most visible aspects of the environments inhabited by the hybrids and the species that gave rise to them. The history of the landscape is then considered by studying the geological maps and climatic variations, which may indicate previous displacements of rocks, past earthquakes or prolonged variations in rainfall or temperature. These historical changes may increase or decrease the proximity of plants or animals with each other, which may or may not influence the formation of new species.</p>
<p>In the case of the above-mentioned orchids, the hybrids inhabited both the <em>restinga</em>, the typical environment of <em>Epidendrum puniceolutem</em>, and dunes, sites where <em>E. fulgens</em> is found. “This versatility suggests that some regions of the genome can be exchanged among these species, giving the hybrid a greater capacity to utilize the habitat,” says botanist Fábio Pinheiro, research associate at the São Paulo Botanical Institute. “Natural hybridization is probably one of the explanations for the high degree of diversification that we observe in the genus <em>Epidendrum, </em>which includes almost 1,500 species.”</p>
<div class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-full wp-image-69637" title="060-063_hibridos_185-2_02" src="http://revistapesquisa.fapesp.br/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/060-063_hibridos_185-2_02.jpg" alt="" width="290" height="242" /><p class="wp-caption-text"><span class="media-credits-inline"> EDUARDO CESAR</span>A hybridw ith two colors of flower: red like Epidendrum puniceolutem, and yellow like E. fulgens<span class="media-credits"> EDUARDO CESAR</span></p></div>
<p>As a precaution, in a presentation in May 2009 at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, London, Pinheiro did not mention the number of chromosomes present in the hybrid, for fear of the reaction. “But the orchid specialists at Kew asked, and, when they saw the orchid, they didn’t believe it. They said something was wrong, but then they accepted it,” Pinheiro says. The prevailing view is that different species do not interbreed naturally and that any hybrids that do form, are sterile. The argument is that the germ cells are not compatible and are thus unable to combine and form viable offspring.</p>
<p>“However, most plants are in fact the result of natural or induced hybridization events between closely related species”, says Fábio de Barros, coordinator of the project at the Botanical Institute. Induced hybridization is used to create unique species of orchids and plants used in food production, such as corn and sugar cane. Usually hybrids have an advantage: in the case of food plants, they tend to be more disease resistant and more productive than either of the parent species. “Darwin had already written that hybrids may be sterile or fertile but could not prove it because, at that time, there was no such thing as using molecular markers to identify the genetic signatures of fertile hybrids,” says Barros. “Apparently hybridization is quite abundant and seems to have a much larger role in evolution than we ever imagined.”</p>
<p>Botanists have already observed other such cases. Orchids of the genus <em>Ophrys, </em>from the Mediterranean region, regularly form hybrids that are highly fertile. Moreover, a cross between two short plants with yellow flowers from Europe and the United States, <em>Senecio squalidus</em> and <em>S. vulgaris</em>, produced a hybrid that attracts more pollinators and could produce more fruit than either of the parental species.</p>
<p><strong>Mixed spaces<br /></strong>Animals also form fertile hybrids. Thales Freitas, a geneticist at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS), observed that two species of subterranean rodents known as tuco-tucos – <em>Ctenomys minutus</em>, with 42 to 50 chromosomes, and <em>C.<ins cite="mailto:Editor%201"> </ins>lami</em>, with 54 to 58 chromosomes – are able to cross and sometimes produce fertile offspring. The result depends on the species of the male and female parent: if the female is <em>Ctenomys minutus</em> and the male is <em>Ctenomys lami</em>, the offspring can be fertile, whereas the reverse combination, male <em>Ctenomys minutus</em> crossed with female <em>Ctenomys lami</em>, results in sterile hybrids. A similar situation has been observed for the Atlantic Forest frogs of the genus <em>Phyllomedusa</em>. At the State University of São Paulo (UNESP) and the University of Porto, Portugal, Tuliana Brunes studies the formation of species of <em>Phyllomedusa, </em>the genetic identification of hybrids, and the historical origins of hybrid zones.</p>
<p>The most likely places in which hybrids can arise are in areas where populations of closely related species of plants or animals that were once separated, come into contact. “We have discovered hybrids most frequently in zones of ecological transition, known as ecotones, in which two distinctive types of vegetation mix and facilitate the chances of contact between populations of plants and animals that are otherwise geographically isolated,” says Jão Alexandrino of the Federal University of São Paulo (UNIFESP).</p>

<p>Years ago, when he was at the University of California, Berkeley, Alexandrino verified this phenomenon while studying fertile hybrids resulting from the cross between two closely related species of salamanders occurring in riparian woodland habitats in California. Thus far, he, Tuliana, and Celio Haddad (of Unesp) have verified that the resident frogs form hybrids where two types of Atlantic Forest, one more humid and the other drier, are adjacent in the interior of São Paulo State. The hybrids of orchids and tuco-tucos were also found in habitats occupied by groups of species that now coexist. It is probable that this outcome was the result of climatic variations that brought together previously isolated areas or influenced changes in the geographic distributions of certain plants and animals over thousands of years.</p>
<p>A consequence of the processes that lead to the separation of species, thus resulting in crossing or hybridization between closely related species, is that forests with high levels of biodiversity, such as the Atlantic Forest, become “a cauldron of new species in continuous transformation,” in the definition of Nuno Ferrand of the University of Porto. “The wealth of biological diversity is not only measured by the number of species but also by the processes that may give rise to new species,” said Clarisse Palma da Silva from the Botanical Institute.</p>
<p>The best known mechanism for the formation of new species of animals or plants is the accumulation of genetic mutations in the offspring of the same species. Although it is clear that new species may also result from the clustering of populations of different species that were once separated, not all of these issues have been resolved. “The rules governing the emergence and differentiation of species are not entirely clear because evolution is a continuous process that follows different paths for long periods of time,” said Craig Moritz, a biologist at the University of California, Berkeley.</p>
<p><strong>Effects of isolation<br /></strong>One of the principles that has survived since Darwin is that isolation promotes genetic diversity and the divergence of species over thousands or millions of years. A well-known example is the two species of pit vipers restricted to the islands off the southern coast of São Paulo – <em>Bothrops insularis</em>, which only occurs on Queimada Grande Island, and <em>Bothrops alcatraz</em>, which is found only on Alcatrazes Island, located less than 50 km away – that began to differentiate in complete isolation from one another approximately 18,000 years ago (see <em>Pesquisa</em> <em>FAPESP</em> <em>No.132</em>).</p>
<p>However, much more may still be learned about these species. The research of Ana Carolina Carnaval, a Brazilian biologist now working at City College of New York, indicates that variations in the climate (from dry to wet) and altitude (from zero to 1,600 meters) along a strip of coastline 5,000 km long in the Atlantic Forest favored the isolation, emergence, and development of new species with a greater intensity than in the Amazon, a region where the variations in climate and elevation are not nearly as pronounced. These isolated areas that separate and protect plants and animals form so-called refugia, stretches of forest that survived the intense climatic changes over the millions of years that caused a reduction in nearby forests and the consequent elimination of the animal populations that lived there.</p>
<p>Luciano Beheregaray, a Brazilian biologist who teaches at Flinders University and Macquarie University in Australia, indicated that researchers from the United States, Great Britain and France lead the increasing global scientific efforts in this area, which is called phylogeography and combines genetic, geographical, geological and historical analyses. In the survey by Beheregaray, Brazil, despite its status as the richest country in terms of biodiversity, ranked 15th among the 100 countries examined.</p>
<p>“We can go much further, making more complete analyses of our data, instead of dying on the beach,” warned Celio Haddad. “We collected the data, but it is the specialists from other countries that analyzed these data. We should be leaders in this area and not merely towed along.”</p>

                <i>Snipehunt</i> 1994, No. 19. Cover art by Sean Tejaratchi
                
              </p>
            
          </div>
        

        

        

        
        

        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
          
            
            <p><span class="dropcap">I</span>n the Portland of the late ’80s and ’90s, there was one publication that influenced and guided the music and arts community more than any other: a free, wildly designed, oversized newsprint magazine called <i>Snipehunt</i>.</p>
            
          
            
              <p>Started in 1988 by now-famed poster artist Mike King, the magazine came into its own when contributor Kathy Molloy took the helm a couple years in. During these years, Portland was a very different city: The arts community was small, still finding its footing, and looking to grow.</p>
            
          
            
              <p>“I used to beg good bands that I liked to move here,” long-time Portland radio DJ Brandon Lieberman told me. “And back then almost no one wanted to.”</p>
            
          
            
              <p>The scene that inspired <i>Snipehunt</i> featured bands that weren’t getting media coverage and writers and artists without an outlet. The magazine soon became a breeding ground for local creators, and its contributor list is a peek at the kind of local talent and energy emerging during that time: novelist and screenwriter Jon Raymond, current Portland city commissioner Chloe Eudaly, filmmaker and installation artist Vanessa Renwick, local writer and publisher Kevin Sampsell, novelist Rene Denfeld, <i>Crap Hound</i> and <i>Liar Town</i> creator Sean Tejaratchi. For many of the contributors, <i>Snipehunt</i> was their first publication, their first opportunity to regularly try out their ideas on an audience.</p>
            
          
            
              <p>A typical issue of S<i>nipehunt</i> had interviews with local and national bands, pages of comics from independent artists, scene reports from West Coast cities, oddball prose pieces, political action coverage, and pages of reviews—albums, zines, live shows, films, and books. It was a broad take on DIY culture, loosely based in the punk scene but covering artists and subjects far beyond the imposed limitations of that world.</p>
            
          
            
              <p>With the magazine’s history largely absent from the internet, its name unfamiliar to the majority of current Portlanders, and physical evidence of its existence difficult to come by, I reached out to a couple dozen of its contributors to provide me—and the rest of new Portland—with a much-needed history lesson.</p>

             <hr /><div style="text-align:center;">   <h2><i>Snipehunt</i> in the Community</h2> </div>  <p><b>Filmmaker Vanessa Renwick:</b> You couldn’t wait ’til <i>Snipehunt</i> came out. The paper published so infrequently, and since there was nothing like it at all, when it finally came out it was just bursting at the seams with so many good things inside. It was like someone jumping out of a birthday cake 10 million times. They would just keep coming: these incredible things popping out at you.</p>
            
          
            
              <p><b>Author Jon Raymond:</b> It was amazing how lively it was... an explosion of people and images. I loved the size and the color, the texture of it. It was just an amazing object. And having a big print component of the scene felt kind of glamorous. Like, “look at this multimedia thing happening here. We can do a lot of different things.”</p>
            
          
            
              <p><b>DJ/Writer Ted Thieman:</b> <i>Snipehunt</i> was pretty integral [to the scene]. Kathy had it everywhere—in the record stores, in the clubs. And it was right around the time that X-Ray [Café] was happening. A band would get into <i>Snipehunt</i> and their next show would be packed.</p>
            
          
            
              <p><b>Voodoo Doughnut/X-Ray Café Co-Founder Tres Shannon:</b> Everything was smoke signals and secret passwords back then. And <i>Snipehunt</i> was that smoke signal and secret password. If you got a <i>Snipehunt</i>, you knew what was going on.</p>
            
          
            
              <p><b>Writer Richard Martin:</b> It had a persona to it. Before the word “brand” became a dirty word, it was a good brand. <i>Snipehunt</i> was just cool. And it was just such an original publication. Things that came out after it, like <i>Vice</i> or some of these other sort of irreverent magazines, could never be what <i>Snipehunt</i> was.</p>
            
          
            
              <p><b>Tres Shannon:</b> It had <i>so much</i> information. I mean it would take you fucking three months to read it. By the time you finally got through the whole thing, the next one was available.</p>
            
          
            
             <hr /><div class="article-image article-image-inline image-center">                                <img src="https://media1.fdncms.com/portmerc/imager/u/large/23215946/img_9501-2.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="img_9501-2.jpg" /><p>                   Kathy Molloy’s column                                    </p>                            </div>
            
          
            
             <hr /><div style="text-align:center;">   <h2>Kathy Molloy—The Heart Of <i>Snipehunt</i></h2> </div>  <p><span class="dropcap">E</span>arly on in my interviews, I learned that any history of <i>Snipehunt</i> also had to be a profile of Kathy Molloy. The people I interviewed often talked about <i>Snipehunt</i> and Molloy interchangeably—their relationship to the publication intertwining and shifting with their relationship to her. Even though <i>Snipehunt</i> had hundreds of contributing writers and artists over the years, Molloy and <i>Snipehunt</i> are inseparable. In my interview with contributor and former New Bad Things member Matthew Hattie Hein, he captured what everyone seemed to feel: “I guess the right thing to do is to talk about <i>Snipehunt</i> and not Kathy—but to me they’re the same.”</p>
            
          
            
              <p>While the magazine under Kathy maintained the punk-fanzine aesthetic Mike King had established, and stayed generally music-focused, it was just as likely you’d open an issue to a review of the latest Guided by Voices album as you would an article about dismantling the patriarchy. Molloy served as both an arbiter of taste and a moral compass for her community—regularly criticizing the corporate influences seeping into the Northwest DIY community in the wake of early ’90s grunge. As writer Kathleen McConnell noted, “Kathy said <i>Snipehunt</i> wasn’t just about music and documenting music events or music projects. It was about creating a whole way of life.”</p>
            
          
            
              <p>Following the end of <i>Snipehunt</i> in late 1996/early 1997, Molloy began cutting people out of her life, and in the early 2000s moved to rural British Columbia. She’s largely managed to keep any evidence of herself off the internet and, of the more than 25 people I spoke with for this story, no one had heard from her in over a decade. I tried contacting her, as did many of those I interviewed, without any luck. While Molloy’s voice is notably absent from this history, everyone I interviewed made sure her presence was felt.</p>
            
          
            
             <div class="article-image article-image-inline image-center">                                <img src="https://media2.fdncms.com/portmerc/imager/u/large/23215945/snipehunt-no-19-_cover-by-sean-tejaratchi_-portrait-of-kathy.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="snipehunt-no-19-_cover-by-sean-tejaratch" /><p>                   1994, No. 19.

A portrait of Kathy Molloy with <i>Snipehunt</i> writers as severed heads.                                    </p>                            </div> <p><b>Artist Eliza Tuli Pierson:</b> Kathy always had either bright pink, purple, or blue hair. And she was covered in tattoos, nose piercings. She was very sturdily built; pale skin. You couldn’t miss her. And she wore the most interesting clothing. She’d wear all purple one day. She’d wear a skirt made out of nice silk with a tank top printed for her by a friend, a scarf, and a leather jacket. She had great taste.</p>
            
          
            
              <p><b>Print Artist Alec “Icky” Dunn:</b> She was an awesome person. Really charismatic. Going to clubs with her—I mean, she wouldn’t even have to be on the guest list, she’d just walk in. It was kind of an entourage situation. Drinks were free. You’d go backstage to interview a band and they’d be like, “Who’s this weird lady?”</p>
            
          
            
              <p><b>Richard Martin:</b> She knew exactly what she wanted and what was going to be in <i>Snipehunt</i>, and if it didn’t fit into her world-view it probably wasn’t going in there.</p>
            
          
            
              <p><b>Musician Matthew Hattie Hein:</b> There was a lot of not-doing in Portland in the ’90s. There’s a lot of hanging out on the porch and waking up at noon. I’m certainly guilty of it. I spent a lot of time doing crosswords and smoking cigarettes. The D part of DIY—that’s a very unique feature when I think of what a huge operation [<i>Snipehunt</i>] was. And that lines up with Kathy submitting ideas to [other] zines. Just suggesting: <i>You can do this yourself. Here’s how.</i></p>
            
          
            
              <p><b>Eliza Tuli Pierson:</b> [Molloy and <i>Snipehunt</i>] gave people the sense they could do something that would be taken seriously if they took themselves seriously—because Kathy had such a work ethic. And she was tough on people if they were flaky. She was like, “You say you’re going to do this, so you better show up, you better do it, you better be there.” She was a very intense person. But people became really motivated around her, because you couldn’t resist her energy.</p>
            
          
            
              <p><b>Portland Commissioner Chloe Eudaly:</b> My fondest memories of Kathy are as a hub for so many people. Whether it was people in Portland or the West Coast or the entire country who were involved in similar efforts—indie bands, DIY publishing, visual art—they came together around her. She wasn’t the most nurturing person, so I don’t think I’d call her a “mother hen,” but she did bring people together. And those figures are kind of rare. She had a huge impact.</p>
            
          
            
              <p><b>Eliza Tuli Pierson:</b> She was like a politician. Not in a full-of-shit way, but she just had this way of connecting with people. You felt like what she was doing was important and she made you feel important. She was like the punk mayor of Portland.</p>
            
          
            
              <p><b>Writer Ana Helena:</b> I ended up being kind of Kathy’s personal servant. I think that’s why she was a goddess, because she could make you serve her. Everyone around her.</p>

             <hr /><div style="text-align:center;">   <h2>How it Worked</h2> </div>  <p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he <i>Snipehunt</i> office was initially in Kathy’s rental house in the Woodlawn neighborhood of Northeast Portland, but relocated when she bought a home a few miles away on Albina Avenue, where Atlas Tattoo is located today. The entire main floor of the house was dedicated to producing <i>Snipehunt</i>, and its always-open door made it a community hub.</p>
            
          
            
              <p>While finding circulation numbers for <i>Snipehunt</i> isn’t easy, Molloy noted in her introduction to a 1992 issue that she’d made 7,000 copies, and in 1994 mentioned it was up to 13,000. Given that issues from 1995 and 1996 are the ones I came across most often in archives and people’s collections, it’s likely that its circulation kept growing until the end. While these aren’t huge numbers in terms of local magazines or newspapers, they’re impressive when you consider it was a magazine without a formal distribution system being run out of a living room.</p>
            
          
            
              <p>“We’d get them delivered and it would take up the whole front room,” Dunn told me. “There would just be stacks and stacks.”</p>
            
          
            
              <p>To most people, <i>Snipehunt</i> probably wouldn’t look much different than today’s average alt-weekly: It’s slightly bigger, folds horizontally across the middle, and has a more playful aesthetic. But it managed to pack more in with far fewer ads. Today, for something similar to be free, it would almost certainly be funded by Red Bull, or at least littered with as many ads as articles. Part of what makes <i>Snipehunt</i> so impressive now is the ambition: It was giant, filled with voices, free, and produced without a parent company, board of directors, editorial team, or corporate ad dollars.</p>
            
          
            
              <p><b>Writer Fred Landeen:</b> Going to her compound was always surprising. You’d always see someone you knew from Satyricon or from a band or from another zine. They’d stopped in to drop something off and she’d put them to work. They’d be gluing bits of paper to the layout sheet or trying to typeset something on an early Mac. There were little bits of paper everywhere. <i>Everywhere.</i> They were stuck on the floor, ceiling, walls.... Every surface had little cut marks from where an X-ACTO knife had gone through a page or off the edge of some cardboard. There were spray-painted stencils and screen-printed things. Everything was a visual riot of color and bits of paper. If you dropped your contact lens in there, forget it.</p>

There were little bits of paper everywhere. </i>Everywhere.<i>”</i>—Fred Landeen </h3><hr /><p><b>Kevin Sampsell:</b> It seemed kind of ramshackle. Not in a bad way, but because that’s the way it was in 1991 to ’93. I just brought my reviews in on paper, or maybe a floppy disc, and she put them on her computer. I can’t remember. It was right around the cusp of when people started using email. I don’t really remember any sort of editing going on.</p>
            
          
            
              <p><b>Ana Helena:</b> When the magazine was close to publication, it was a frenzy. Everyone working at all hours. We all learned layout. It was like journalism class every three months.</p>
            
          
            
              <p><b>Graphic Artist Sean Tejaratchi:</b> It was quarterly, so every couple months there would be this flurry of activity and all these people would sort of coalesce—come out of the woodwork and do their thing, then part ways and come back for the next one. People and bands from out of town would always stay with her, and she would often involve them in the assembly. There were a lot of guest creators. So it was a social as well as a practical thing.</p>
            
          
            
              <p><b>Artist Dwayne Hedstrom:</b> When the magazine came out, we’d drive up the I-5 corridor [from Vancouver, B.C., to San Francisco], dropping it off in places like Mount Vernon, Bellingham, Everett... wherever there was a weird record store in a small town.</p>
            
          
            
              <p><b>Ana Helena:</b> [When a new issue came out] I’d drive [Molloy] to the post office and she’d send <i>Snipehunt</i> to people all over the world. She’d be like, “Oh man, they’re so far away and so cut off from civilization. They have no idea what’s going on.” It was like her love letter to the world.</p>
            
          
            
             <hr /><p><span class="dropcap">T</span>hrough the Oregon Historical Society, I came across the paste-ups for <i>Snipehunt</i>—the home-assembled master copies that would be sent to the printer<i>.</i> While in some ways the paste-ups revealed it to be more humble than the printed version let on, they also showed the sheer amount of physical labor that went into a single issue—remnants of hot wax and X-ACTO knife debris cling to the pages, and each issue contains spreads with multiple transparency overlays marked with Post-It notes indicating color gradients.</p>
            
          
            
              <p>Among the paste-ups, I found a half-sheet form Molloy had created for putting an issue together. On it, there were the names of nearly 60 contributors, the name of their article, column, comic, or department, each of their respective phone numbers, and whether they’d submitted their piece yet. This small piece of paper was more telling than the paste-ups themselves: <i>Snipehunt</i> may have been ramshackle, but it was a huge operation. As Helena put it, “<i>Snipehunt</i> was a volunteer effort. But it was the king of the volunteer efforts.”</p>

Some of this was simple economics: Molloy had a lot of space to fill and was unable to pay anyone aside from the occasional cover artist. But <i>Snipehunt</i> fostered a community of people who otherwise wouldn’t have come together and, in many cases, helped launch their careers.</p>
            
          
            
              <p><b>Jon Raymond:</b> [From the outside] it felt like a circus. But it was pretty easy to find your way into that world. I came back here from college in ’94. By that time most of my friends were deep into the music world, but I was more in a writing mindframe. And <i>Snipehunt</i> was just one of the most easily accessible places to do anything.</p>
            
          
            
              <p><b>Ana Helena:</b> It definitely gave me a platform that I never had access to before... like interviewing Team Dresch. Just being like, “I’m writing for <i>Snipehunt</i>, I want to do an interview. Can we do this?” And then being put on the front cover of a highly anticipated quarterly magazine—[my] interview with my favorite band at the peak of their game.</p>

              <p><b>Matthew Hattie Hein:</b> We learned so much from <i>Snipehunt</i> because it was <i>kind of</i> professional. It actually had deadlines and a distribution network, and columns and departments, like a weekly magazine.</p>
            
          
            
              <p><b>Sean Tejaratchi:</b> If I hadn’t been involved in S<i>nipehunt</i> I would’ve never done <i>Crap Hound</i>. Well, I don’t know about never... but <i>Crap Hound</i> was a direct result of working on it. Just realizing that, “Oh, this is accessible and anyone can do it.” If a bunch of fucking people in bands can get together and create this publication every two-and-a-half months, I can do my thing without too much effort or money. So it was a huge thing personally, even though I wasn’t involved in the music scene directly.</p>
            
          
            
              <p><b>Jon Raymond:</b> It’s actually really embarrassing reading some of the things I wrote for <i>Snipehunt</i>. They were politically in a good place—I was writing about gentrification, renter’s rights, and stuff like that. But it was really pretentious cultural criticism, kind of pseudo-academic articles. They didn’t care, I could do whatever. I was really against music at that time, just because everyone I knew was just purely music, and I thought something else was being underrepresented. So my stuff was really highbrow in its aspirations—it makes me cringe looking at them now. But I was learning.</p>
            
          
            
               <hr /><p><span class="dropcap">E</span>ven as a music nerd who grew up immersed in the Northwest music scene, my favorite moments of <i>Snipehunt</i> are the articles that have nothing to do with music.

              <p>Vanessa Renwick’s jarring prose piece about attending a seatbelt class and being shown a slideshow of car wrecks and bodies; Tres Shannon’s article about traveling to Super Bowl XXX; Curt Schultz’s semi-apocryphal history of Pez and Pez dispenser obsession; Jennifer Gleach’s “Crush Corner” column which approached the concept of the crush as a playful philosophical challenge; dishwasher Pete Jordan’s “Regular Folks” article about meeting people on his pilgrimage to wash dishes in all 50 states.

Dozens of writers submitted pieces, artists submitted art, and advertisers placed their ads. The whole issue was laid out—but it never went to print. No one was sure if there was a lack of money, or if Molloy was just burnt out, but it was soon clear to everyone involved that there wasn’t going to be a big announcement or a send-off party. <i>Snipehunt</i> was just over.</p>
            
          
            
              <p>Looking back at Molloy’s “My Eye” column suggests the magazine’s ending had been coming since the beginning—a years-long accumulation of factors that began adding up when the Northwest became a place of national media attention in the early 1990s.</p>
            
          
            
              <p>In a 1995 issue, a year or so into being a homeowner, Molloy writes about suddenly not being able to relate to <i>Snipehunt</i> readers.</p>
            
          
            
              <p>“I worry about money for experimental plumbing, not experimental music,” she writes. “I guess it’s my reaction to these modern times, when every 14-year-old with braces has green hair and plays drums in a rock band. Being weird is the norm. Party’s over, time to pay property tax.”</p>
            
          
            
              <p>And in the second-to-last issue of <i>Snipehunt</i>, in spring of 1996, she wrote possibly the closest thing to a farewell that <i>Snipehunt</i> readers would get.</p>
            
          
            
              <p>“It’s not enough anymore to tell people what kind of music they should listen to,” Molloy wrote. “I want to tell people how they should live their lives. Information that is useful like where to buy your food, how to fix your bicycle, and how to make the first move and still smash the patriarchy. Real life matters, not rock journalism.”</p>
            
          
            
              <p>Soon after, Molloy began to change. Again and again, people told me that one day she was one of their best friends and the next she wasn’t. If it was someone she wasn’t particularly close with, she just stopped talking to them. But most of her close friends she cut off after minor indiscretions—a pile of stuff left in her basement, a comment at a party.</p>
            
          
            
              <p>“When Kathy left, it was kind of a scorched earth situation,” Eudaly said. “A lot of us were left a little bewildered by what had happened. And we missed her and missed the sense of community she created for us.”</p>

As soon as you get one piece of your ideal life in place, another part breaks.</p>
            
          
            
              <p>As I was working on this, a friend pointed out that my attempt to write a history of <i>Snipehunt</i> had become a snipe hunt for Kathy Molloy. When I started, I had no idea how impossible it would be to untwine Molloy from <i>Snipehunt;</i> it was such a huge publication, I never imagined one person could have so much influence over it. But I felt a partial history was better than no history at all. So I kept going, hoping that publishing this would bring her out of hiding long enough to say that a <i>Snipehunt</i> history is incomplete without her, that I was a fool to try, and that—before disappearing again—she would set the record straight.</p>

                            <p>Over the last few decades, life expectancy has increased dramatically around the globe. The average person born in 1960, the earliest year the United Nations began keeping global data, <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.LE00.IN">could expect to live to 52.5 years of age</a>. Today, the average is 72. In the UK, where records have been kept longer, this trend is even greater. In 1841, <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/lifeexpectancies/articles/howhaslifeexpectancychangedovertime/2015-09-09">a baby girl was expected to live to just 42 years of age</a>, a boy to 40. In 2016, <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/lifeexpectancies/bulletins/nationallifetablesunitedkingdom/2014to2016">a baby girl could expect to reach 83</a>; a boy, 79.</p><p>The natural conclusion is that both the miracles of modern medicine and public health initiatives have helped us live longer than ever before – so much so that we may, in fact, be running out of innovations to extend life further. In September 2018, the Office for National Statistics confirmed that, in the UK at least, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-45638646">life expectancy has stopped increasing</a>. Beyond the UK, <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/01/180129104914.htm">these gains are slowing worldwide</a>.</p><p>This belief that our species may have reached the peak of longevity is also reinforced by some myths about our ancestors: it’s common belief that ancient Greeks or Romans would have been flabbergasted to see anyone above the age of 50 or 60, for example.</p><p>In fact, while medical advancements have improved many aspects of healthcare, the assumption that human life span has increased dramatically over centuries or millennia is misleading.</p><p>Overall life expectancy, which is the statistic reflected in reports like those above, hasn’t increased so much because we’re living far longer than we used to as a species. It’s increased because more of us, as individuals, are making it that far.</p><p><em>You might also like:<br /></em>• <a href="http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20151001-why-women-live-longer-than-men">Why do women live longer than men?</a> <br />• <a href="http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20160928-why-the-present-day-could-be-the-best-time-to-be-alive">Why the present day could be the best time to be alive</a> <br />• <a href="http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20171220-how-to-be-remembered-in-1000-years">Who will be remembered in 1,000 years?</a></p><blockquote><p> The life span of humans – opposed to life expectancy, which is a statistical construct – hasn’t really changed much at all – Walter Scheidel </p></blockquote><p>“There is a basic distinction between life expectancy and life span,” says Stanford University historian Walter Scheidel, a leading scholar of ancient Roman demography. “The life span of humans – opposed to life expectancy, which is a statistical construct – hasn’t really changed much at all, as far as I can tell.”</p><p>Life expectancy is an average. If you have two children, and one dies before their first birthday but the other lives to the age of 70, their average life expectancy is 35.</p><p>That’s mathematically correct – and it certainly tells us something about the circumstances in which the children were raised. But it doesn’t give us the full picture. It also becomes especially problematic when looking at eras, or in regions, where there are high levels of infant mortality. Most of human history has been blighted by poor survival rates among children, and <a href="http://www.who.int/gho/child_health/mortality/neonatal_infant_text/en/">that continues in various countries today</a>.</p><p>This averaging-out, however, is why it’s commonly said that ancient Greeks and Romans, for example, lived to just 30 or 35. But was that really the case for people who survived the fragile period of childhood, and did it mean that a 35-year-old was truly considered ‘old’?</p><blockquote><p> If one’s thirties were a decrepit old age, ancient writers and politicians don’t seem to have got the message </p></blockquote><p>If one’s thirties were a decrepit old age, ancient writers and politicians don’t seem to have got the message. In the early 7th Century BC, the Greek poet Hesiod wrote that a man should marry “when you are not much less than 30, and not much more”. Meanwhile, ancient Rome’s ‘cursus honorum’ – the sequence of political offices that an ambitious young man would undertake – <a href="http://www.livius.org/articles/concept/cursus-honorum/">didn’t even allow a young man to stand for his first office</a>, that of quaestor, until the age of 30 (under Emperor Augustus, this was later lowered to 25; Augustus himself died at 75). To be consul, you had to be 43 – eight years older than the US’s minimum age limit of 35 to hold a presidency.</p><p>In the 1st Century, <a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137%3Abook%3D7%3Achapter%3D49">Pliny devoted an entire chapter of The Natural History to people who lived longest</a>. Among them he lists the consul M Valerius Corvinos (100 years), Cicero’s wife Terentia (103), a woman named Clodia (115 – and who had 15 children along the way), and the actress Lucceia who performed on stage at 100 years old.</p><p>Then there are tombstone inscriptions and grave epigrams, such as this one for a woman who died in Alexandria in the 3rd Century BC. “She was 80 years old, but able to weave a delicate weft with the shrill shuttle”, the epigram reads admiringly.</p><p>Not, however, that ageing was any easier then than it is now. “Nature has, in reality, bestowed no greater blessing on man than the shortness of life,” <a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137%3Abook%3D7%3Achapter%3D51#note4">Pliny remarks</a>. “The senses become dull, the limbs torpid, the sight, the hearing, the legs, the teeth, and the organs of digestion, all of them die before us…” He can think of only one person, a musician who lived to 105, who had a pleasantly healthy old age. (Pliny himself reached barely half that; he’s thought to have died from volcanic gases during the eruption of Mt Vesuvius, aged 56).</p><p>In the ancient world, at least, it seems people certainly were able to live just as long as we do today. But just how common was it?</p><p><strong>Age of empires</strong></p><p>Back in 1994 a study looked at every man entered into the Oxford Classical Dictionary who lived in ancient Greece or Rome. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1294277/pdf/jrsocmed00089-0029.pdf">Their ages of death were compared</a> to men listed in the more recent Chambers Biographical Dictionary.</p><p>Of 397 ancients in total, 99 died violently by murder, suicide or in battle. Of the remaining 298, those born before 100BC lived to a median age of 72 years. Those born after 100BC lived to a median age of 66. (The authors speculate that the prevalence of dangerous lead plumbing may have led to this apparent shortening of life).</p><p>The median of those who died between 1850 and 1949? Seventy-one years old – just one year less than their pre-100BC cohort.</p><p>Of course, there were some obvious problems with this sample. One is that it was men-only. Another is that all of the men were illustrious enough to be remembered. All we can really take away from this is that privileged, accomplished men have, on average, lived to about the same age throughout history – as long as they weren’t killed first, that is.</p><p>Still, says Scheidel, that’s not to be dismissed. “It implies there must have been non-famous people, who were much more numerous, who lived even longer,” he says.</p><p>Not everyone agrees. “There was an enormous difference between the lifestyle of a poor versus an elite Roman,” says Valentina Gazzaniga, a medical historian at Rome’s La Sapienza University. “The conditions of life, access to medical therapies, even just hygiene – these were all certainly better among the elites.”</p><p>In 2016, Gazzaniga published her research on more than 2,000 ancient Roman skeletons, all working-class people who were buried in common graves. The average age of death was 30, and that wasn’t a mere statistical quirk: a high number of the skeletons were around that age. Many showed the effects of trauma from hard labour, as well as diseases we would associate with later ages, like arthritis.</p><p>Men might have borne numerous injuries from manual labour or military service. But women – who, it's worth noting, also did hard labour such as <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/643231?seq=1/subjects#metadata_info_tab_contents">working in the fields</a> – hardly got off easy. Throughout history, childbirth, often in poor hygienic conditions, is just one reason why women were at particular risk during their fertile years. Even pregnancy itself was a danger.</p><blockquote><p> Being pregnant adversely affects your immune system. Then you tend to be susceptible to other diseases – Jane Humphries </p></blockquote><p>“We know, for example, that being pregnant adversely affects your immune system, because you’ve basically got another person growing inside you,” says Jane Humphries, a historian at the University of Oxford. “Then you tend to be susceptible to other diseases. So, for example, tuberculosis interacts with pregnancy in a very threatening way. And tuberculosis was a disease that had higher female than male mortality.”</p><p>Childbirth was worsened by other factors too. “Women often were fed less than men,” Gazzaniga says. That malnutrition means that young girls often had incomplete development of pelvic bones, which then increased the risk of difficult child labour.</p><p>“The life expectancy of Roman women actually increased with the decline of fertility,” Gazzaniga says. “The more fertile the population is, the lower the female life expectancy.”</p><p><strong>Missing people</strong></p><p>The difficulty in knowing for sure just how long our average predecessor lived, whether ancient or pre-historic, is the lack of data. When trying to determine average ages of death for ancient Romans, for example, <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/~pswpc/pdfs/scheidel/021003.pdf">anthropologists often rely on census returns from Roman Egypt</a>. But because these papyri were used to collect taxes, they often under-reported men – as well as left out many babies and women.</p><p>Tombstone inscriptions, left behind in their thousands by the Romans, are another obvious source. But infants were rarely placed in tombs, poor people couldn’t afford them and families who died simultaneously, such as during an epidemic, also were left out.</p><p>And even if that weren’t the case, there is another problem with relying on inscriptions.</p><p>“You need to live in a world where you have a certain amount of documentation where it can even be possible to tell if someone lived to 105 or 110, and that only started quite recently,” Scheidel points out. “If someone actually lived to be 111, that person might not have known.”</p><p>As a result, much of what we think we know about ancient Rome’s statistical life expectancy comes from life expectancies in comparable societies. Those tell us that as many as one-third of infants died before the age of one, and half of children before age 10. After that age your chances got significantly better. If you made it to 60, you’d probably live to be 70.</p><p>Taken altogether, life span in ancient Rome probably wasn’t much different from today. It may have been slightly less “because you don’t have this invasive medicine at end of life that prolongs life a little bit, but not dramatically different”, Scheidel says. “You can have extremely low average life expectancy, because of, say, pregnant women, and children who die, and still have people to live to 80 and 90 at the same time. They are just less numerous at the end of the day because all of this attrition kicks in.”</p><p>Of course, that attrition is not to be sniffed at. Particularly if you were an infant, a woman of childbearing years or a hard labourer, you’d be far better off choosing to live in year 2018 than 18. But that still doesn’t mean our life span is actually getting significantly longer as a species.</p><p><strong>On the record</strong></p><p>The data gets better later in human history once governments begin to keep careful records of births, marriages and deaths – at first, particularly of nobles.</p><blockquote><p> From 1200 to 1745, 21-year-olds would reach an average age of anywhere between 62 and 70 years </p></blockquote><p>Those records show that child mortality remained high. But if a man got to the age of 21 and didn’t die by accident, violence or poison, he could be expected to live almost as long as men today: <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=jIMHCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA8&amp;lpg=PA8&amp;dq=guy+sharpe%27s+peerage&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=tZwob0HISg&amp;sig=rQtW27BM_bBF0xgeme2kkBYhMmw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwin3JHb9uTbAhXCqFkKHcRlDqUQ6AEIZjAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=guy%20sharpe's%20peerage&amp;f=fals">from 1200 to 1745, 21-year-olds would reach an average age of anywhere between 62 and 70 years</a> – except for the 14th Century, when the bubonic plague cut life expectancy to a paltry 45.</p><p>Did having money or power help? Not always. <a href="kings%20lived%20about%20six%20years%20less%20than">One analysis of some 115,000 European nobles found that kings lived about six years less</a> than lesser nobles, like knights.

This was likely because <a href="https://www.nuff.ox.ac.uk/economics/history/Paper85/johansson85.pdf">royals tended to prefer to live for most of the year in cities</a>, where they were exposed to more diseases. <em>(Is it still true that cities are less safe? Find out more in our story on <a href="http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20180531-where-are-the-worlds-healthiest-places-to-live">whether the countryside is a healthier place to live today</a>).</em></p><p>But interestingly, when the revolution came in medicine and public health, it helped elites before the rest of the population. By the late 17th Century, English nobles who made it to 25 went on to live longer than their non-noble counterparts – even as they continued to live in the more risk-ridden cities.</p><blockquote><p> Once the dangerous childhood years were passed… life expectancy in the mid-Victorian period was not markedly different from what it is today – Judith Rowbotham and Paul Clayton </p></blockquote><p>Surely, by the soot-ridden era of Charles Dickens, life was unhealthy and short for nearly everyone? Still no. As researchers Judith Rowbotham, now at the University of Plymouth, and Paul Clayton, of Oxford Brookes University, write, “once the dangerous childhood years were passed… <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2587384/">life expectancy in the mid-Victorian period was not markedly different from what it is today</a>”. A five-year-old girl would live to 73; a boy, to 75.</p><p>Not only are these numbers comparable to our own, they may be even better. Members of today’s working-class (a more accurate comparison) live to around 72 years for men and 76 years for women.</p><p>“This relative lack of progress is striking, especially given the many environmental disadvantages during the mid-Victorian era and the state of medical care in an age when modern drugs, screening systems and surgical techniques were self-evidently unavailable,” Rowbotham and Clayton write.</p><p>They argue that if we think we’re living longer than ever today, this is because our records go back to around 1900 – which they call a “misleading baseline”, as it was at a time when nutrition had decreased and when many men started to smoke.</p><p><strong>Pre-historic people</strong></p><p>What about if we look in the other direction in time – before any records at all were kept?</p><p>Although it is obviously difficult to collect this kind of data, <a href="http://www.unm.edu/~hkaplan/KaplanHillLancasterHurtado_2000_LHEvolution.pdf">anthropologists have tried to substitute by looking at today's hunter-gatherer groups</a>, such as the Ache of Paraguay and Hadza of Tanzania. They found that while the probability of a newborn’s survival to age 15 ranged between 55% for a Hadza boy up to 71% for an Ache boy, once someone survived to that point, they could expect to live until they were between 51 and 58 years old. <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/adca/0f024f94683fa38d67648408cd6577d032b4.pdf">Data from modern-day foragers</a>, who have no access to medicine or modern food, write Michael Gurven and Cristina Gomes, finds that “while at birth mean life expectancies range from 30 to 37 years of life, women who survive to age 45 can expect to live an additional 20 to 22 years” – in other words, from 65 to 67 years old.</p><p>Archaeologists Christine Cave and Marc Oxenham of Australian National University have recently found the same. <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319845926_Sex_and_the_elderly_Attitudes_to_long-lived_women_and_men_in_early_Anglo-Saxon_England">Looking at dental wear on the skeletons of Anglo-Saxons buried about 1,500 years ago</a>, they found that of 174 skeletons, the majority belonged to people who were under 65 – but there also were 16 people who died between 65 and 74 years old and nine who reached at least 75 years of age.</p><p>Our maximum lifespan may not have changed much, if at all. But that’s not to delegitimise the extraordinary advances of the last few decades which have helped so many more people reach that maximum lifespan, and live healthier lives overall.</p><p>Perhaps that’s why, when asked what past era, if any, she’d prefer to live in, Oxford’s Humphries doesn’t hesitate.</p><p>“Definitely today,” she says. “I think women’s lives in the past were pretty nasty and brutish – if not so short.”</p><p><em>Amanda Ruggeri is BBC Future's senior editor.

The deal values Cruise at $14.6 billion. The deal is important for Honda because until now it has been a laggard in the race to build self-driving cars.</p>
<p>Honda also <a href="http://www.hondanews.com/releases/honda-joins-with-cruise-and-general-motors-to-build-new-autonomous-vehicle">said on Wednesday</a> that it plans to invest $2 billion over the next 12 years to develop and manufacture self-driving cars based on Cruise's software.</p>
<p>"Honda will work jointly with Cruise and General Motors to fund and develop a purpose-built autonomous vehicle for Cruise that can serve a wide variety of use cases and be manufactured at high volume for global deployment," Honda said in a press release.</p>
<p>Honda has been <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015/09/12/honda-self-driving-cars-get-california-approval/">working on autonomous vehicles</a> since at least 2015, but progress has been slow. In 2015, the company said it hoped to have a partially self-driving car <a href="https://www.businesstoday.in/sectors/auto/honda-motor-says-plans-to-market-partial-self-driving-car-in-2020/story/225097.html">ready by 2020</a> but that a fully self-driving car <a href="https://www.news.com.au/technology/innovation/motoring/honda-says-autonomous-cars-wont-be-ready-until-2030-at-the-earliest-despite-what-apple-and-google-may-claim/news-story/0ca6fe4c8b0a7235cc9d0f58ff6bfb59">won't be ready until the 2030s</a>.</p>
<p>In 2017, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/8/15761272/honda-self-driving-cars-autonomous-level-4-date">Honda said</a> it was aiming to offer freeway-only self-driving capabilities in 2020 and then reach "level 4" capability—cars that are fully self-driving, but only in certain locations and weather conditions—by 2025. That compares unfavorably to Waymo, which is planning to launch a level 4 taxi service this year. Cruise is aiming to launch a level 4 taxi service next year.</p>
<p>Honda's new plan is to build self-driving cars based on Cruise's hardware and software designs. So far, Cruise has focused on modifying the Chevy Bolt for autonomous capabilities. But this new Honda vehicle will be designed from the ground up for autonomous operation.</p>
<p>"Honda will work with Cruise and GM to develop an innovative, space-efficient autonomous vehicle that delivers an exceptional experience and minimizes congestion on crowded city streets," Vogt <a href="https://medium.com/kylevogt/honda-joins-the-party-25a945ea8805">said in a blog post</a> announcing the deal.</p>
<p>This could potentially give Honda a big shortcut to fully autonomous vehicles. Cruise may or may not achieve its own goal of launching a commercial service in 2019. But it seems very likely that the company's technology will be ready long before Honda's own target of 2025 for level 4 vehicles.</p>
<p>Cruise's main rival, Waymo, has been following a similar approach. Waymo knows it's not realistic to manufacture self-driving cars itself, so it has instead signed deals with other automakers. Its initial self-driving service will be built around <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/01/waymo-races-gm-to-deploy-self-driving-cars-orders-thousands-of-minivans/">modified Chrysler Pacifica minivans</a>—Waymo <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/06/as-uber-and-tesla-struggle-with-driverless-cars-waymo-moves-forward/">announced in June</a> that it had ordered 62,000 of them. In the meantime, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/03/a-cab-ride-in-a-jaguar-waymo-will-go-classy-for-20000-electric-robotaxis/">Waymo is working with Jaguar</a> on a version of the I-PACE that's custom-built for self-driving operation, which is due out in a couple of years.</p>
<p>The Honda announcement is another signal that Vogt has carved out significant autonomy for himself and his team inside the GM corporate hierarchy. Since the 2016 acquisition, Cruise has been a wholly owned subsidiary of GM. But then this spring, Cruise announced that it had <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/06/as-uber-and-tesla-struggle-with-driverless-cars-waymo-moves-forward/">accepted a $2.25 billion investment</a> from Softbank.</p>
<p>Now Cruise has three shareholders: GM, Softbank, and Honda. GM still holds a large majority of the shares in Cruise. But having minority shareholders gives Vogt more independence, since he needs to take in minority shareholders' interests as well as GM's. The new structure also makes it easier for Cruise to offer its employees stock options in Cruise rather than GM—giving them much more potential upside if the company is successful.</p>

		<p>Iron Ox isn’t like most robotics companies. Instead of trying to flog you its technology, it wants to sell you food.</p>

		





		<p>As the firm’s cofounder Brandon Alexander puts it: “We are a farm and will always be a farm.”</p>

		<p>But it’s no ordinary farm. For starters, the company’s 15 human employees share their work space with robots who quietly go about the business of tending rows and rows of leafy greens.</p>

		<p>Today Iron Ox is opening its first production facility in San Carlos, near San Francisco. The 8,000-square-foot indoor hydroponic facility—which is attached to the startup’s offices—will be producing leafy greens at a rate of roughly 26,000 heads a year. That’s the production level of a typical outdoor farm that might be five times bigger. The opening is the next big step toward fulfilling the company’s grand vision: a fully autonomous farm where software and robotics fill the place of human agricultural workers, <a href="https://www.newamericaneconomy.org/news/ten-year-decline-u-s-farm-labor-cost-u-s-economy-3-1b-annually-crop-production-report-shows/">which are currently in short supply.</a></p>

		<p>Iron Ox isn’t selling any of the food it produces just yet (it is still in talks with a number of local restaurants and grocers). So for now, those tens of thousands of heads of lettuce are going to a local food bank and to the company salad bar. Its employees had better <em>love</em>  eating lettuce.</p>

		<p>The farm’s non-lettuce-consuming staff consists of a series of robotic arms and movers. The arms individually pluck the plants from their hydroponic trays and transfer them to new trays as they increase in size, maximizing their health and output—a luxury most outdoor farms don’t have. Big white mechanical movers carry the 800-pound water-filled trays around the facility.</p>

		<p>At first, making sure these different machines worked together was tricky. “We had different robots doing different tasks, but they weren’t integrated together into a production environment,” says Alexander.</p>

		<p>So Iron Ox has developed software—nicknamed “The Brain”—to get them to collaborate. Like an all-seeing eye, it keeps watch over the farm, monitoring things like nitrogen levels, temperature, and robot location. It orchestrates both robot and human attention wherever it is needed.</p>

		<p>Yes, although most of the operation is automated, it still does require a bit of human input. Currently, workers help with seeding and processing of crops, but Alexander says he hopes to automate these steps.</p>

		<p>But why go to the trouble of automating farming at all?</p>

		<p>Alexander sees it as solving two problems in one: the shortage of agricultural workers and the distances that fresh produce currently has to be shipped.</p>

		<p>Rather than eliminating jobs, the company hopes, the robots will fill the gaps in the industry’s workforce. And he believes that by making it possible to grow crops close to urban areas without paying city-level salaries, the automated farms will enable stores to chose vegetables fresher than those that had to travel thousands of miles to get there. That is, assuming the startup can get its prices to match those of traditional competitors.</p>

		
	

		
			
		

		

	
	
	<p>“The problem with the indoor [farm] is the initial investment in the system,” says <a href="https://abe.ufl.edu/people/ampatzidis-yiannis/">Yiannis Ampatzidis</a>, an assistant professor of agricultural engineering at the University of Florida. “You have to invest a lot up front. A lot of small growers can’t do that.” This could risk creating a gap between the big farming institutions and smaller family-owned operations, in terms of gaining access to new technology.</p>

		<p>Despite this, Ampatzidis says that bringing automation to both indoor and outdoor farming is necessary to help a wider swath of the agricultural industry solve the long-standing labor shortage.</p>

		<p>“If we don’t find another way to bring people [to the US] for labor, automation is the only way to survive,” he says.</p>

            <div>
<p><span>Let’s get one thing straight: We love MOOCs and ‘learn at your own pace’ training options. </span></p>
<p><span>The flexibility and convenience offered by these kinds of learning models have made digital skills training much more accessible than ever before. The trouble is, </span><span>completion rates for these kinds of courses and programs have traditionally been very low, </span><span>with rates </span><a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2013/03/08/researchers-explore-who-taking-moocs-and-why-so-many-drop-out"><span>anywhere from 0.5% to 10%</span></a><span>. </span></p>
<p><span>Why that is may have a lot to do with human nature. </span><span>Here’s why we need more than ‘learn at your own pace’ learning models. </span></p>
<p><b>Learners Need to Attend to Succeed</b></p>
<p><span>According to </span><a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3102/0034654310362998"><span>Researchers at SUNY Albany</span></a><span>, student success is directly related to student attendance. In fact, they concluded that attendance is the single most important predictor of high grades, a better predictor than SAT scores, high school GPA, study skills or study habits. Their meta-analysis incorporated almost a century of data and included more than 28,000 student outcomes, leading them to conclude that “the use of the online classroom resources and improved textbooks have not decreased the importance of attending class.” </span></p>
<p><span>In the UK, a causal effect of absence on student performance was determined by </span><a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/economics/research/workingpapers/2008/twerp_820.pdf"><span>University of Warwick researchers</span></a><span>, who studied undergraduate Economics students over a period of three years. High-performing students’ grades were hardest hit by cutting classes. Likewise, class attendance was </span><a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.11120/ened.2010.05010064"><span>statistically proven</span></a><span> to be a “key determinant of academic performance” for Engineering students at the University of Exeter, even when students had unlimited and unrestricted access to online lecture notes. </span></p>
<p><b>Learners Need Access to Expertise</b></p>
<p><span>Why does attendance make such a difference for course performance? In the Warwick and Exeter studies, all students had access to online course materials and textbooks. Only those students who attended the in-class lectures and tutorials had access to instructors. They benefited from regular face time with a subject matter expert. </span></p>
<p><span>A major challenge with learning on your own can be if you get stuck on a concept, a task, or a problem sequence. When instructors are not readily accessible to take questions, students tend to flounder. Instructors also articulate the metacognitive framework for what’s under study, i.e. they help students to appreciate and develop best practices for learning. A </span><a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/people/research/csrmaj/daniel_onah_edulearn14.pdf"><span>study conducted by the University of Warwick</span></a><span> found that one of the primary causes of MOOC dropout was the lack of instructor support provided when the course becomes challenging.</span></p>
<p><span>Sure, a few exceptional students do just fine cutting class until the day of the exam. But these people are just that, an exception. Live interaction with a knowledgeable instructor remains an important component of learning, for many reasons. Harman Singh, founder of WizIQ, explained one of the most common to </span><a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3034600/can-people-really-learn-at-their-own-pace"><i><span>Fast Company</span></i></a><span>, “The real problem is when you get stuck, no matter how motivated you are, you can’t get through a concept. I need an instructor, a teacher, to help me get through some tough subjects.” </span><span><br /></span><span><br /></span><b>Learners Need Other Students</b></p>
<p><span>Attendance is also crucial for how it feeds student engagement. This was a lesson learned by Harvard Professor David J. Malan, who now encourages regular attendance for his popular 800-student Introduction to Computer Science course. </span></p>
<p><span>In the 2016/17 school year, </span><a href="https://medium.com/@cs50/this-shall-be-cs50-2016-faed96945f81"><span>Malan told students</span></a><span> they need only attend the first and last class meetings. The rest of the semester they would have free and open access to the course material online, and could choose to learn on their own, however and whenever they wished. He </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NGtWHikRGMWMDpAsB41l7nuWHjnJ_G4-BDp1asK6xaE/edit"><span>reversed that decision</span></a><span> for 2017/18 school year, </span><a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2017/09/05/professor-who-teaches-harvards-largest-class-says-students-should-show"><span>telling </span><i><span>Inside Higher Ed</span></i></a><span> that “enough former students reported something was missing, not just the students themselves but the energy of the audience, that we decided to bring live lectures back this fall.”   </span></p>
<p><span>Learning plainly has a social component; students enjoy and benefit from the participation of others in the class. Perhaps this is especially true in continuing and professional education, where the life and workplace experience of adult students can be considerable. Even more important, peers can be a huge source of motivation and inspiration, in the same way that having workout buddies can make the tough stuff fun and keep you on track even when life gets hectic. </span></p>
<p><b>Learners Need Timelines and Deadlines</b></p>
<p><span>Of course, another time-honoured source of extrinsic motivation are deadlines. Course timelines and deadlines hold students accountable, spurring them to produce, to keep up, to complete. In the learn at your own pace model, timelines and deadlines are negotiable, at best, non-existent, at worst. </span></p>
<p><span>Deadlines can be inconvenient, but how many of us can accomplish non-trivial things like higher education without them? If the stats on MOOCs are any indication, less than 10% of us. While self-implemented deadlines can help with procrastination, a </span><a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1467-9280.00441"><span>study conducted</span></a><span> by Psychologist Dan Ariely explains that they aren’t nearly as effective as those that are externally imposed. </span></p>
<p><b>Complementing ‘Learn At Your Own Pace’</b></p>
<p><span>Whether it’s in a lecture hall or via a virtual classroom, live, real-time interaction with instructors gives students the interaction and guidance they need – and this is why ‘learn at your own pace’ models often fall short. What’s needed is a middle ground that combines the flexibility of online learning options, with the interaction, support, and structure of instructor-led training. Creating this was the driving force behind BrainStation’s Online Live course offerings, which are powered by Synapse, our very own data-driven learning platform. </span></p>
<p><span>Synapse lets our learners attend live lectures, collaborate with other professionals, and get immediate feedback from expert Instructors — just as they would in one of BrainStation’s campuses. So far, the reaction (and student performance) has been tremendous.</span></p>
<p><span>The challenge for educators and learners alike, is to continue developing these types of platforms and methodologies, to ensure we’re balancing an increased demand for online education with the way people actually learn. We’re on the right track.</span></p>

                <p>Denmark announced on Tuesday (2 October) that it will ban the sale of new cars with internal combustion engines by 2030 and hopes to have one million electric and hybrid cars on the roads by then.</p>
<p>In a speech to parliament, Prime Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen said that “diesel and petrol cars in Denmark must be the past. The future is green,” adding that all sales of new fossil-fuel-powered cars will cease in 2030.</p>
<p>Rasmussen’s energy minister, Lars Chr. Lilleholt, announced the ban during the government’s climate council last week but did not mention a timeframe in any detail.</p>
<p>“In just 12 years, we will prohibit the sale of new diesel and petrol cars. And in 17 years, every new car in Denmark must be an electric car or other forms of zero-emissions car,” Rasmussen said, implying that hybrids will be phased out in 2035.</p>

<h4><a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy/interview/danish-mep-fight-continues-for-renewable-energy-in-europe/">Danish MEP: ‘Fight continues’ for renewable energy in Europe</a></h4>
<p>The 32% renewable energy objective for 2030 agreed at the EU level in June was a good result, says Jeppe Kofod, but it’s still insufficient to live up to the Paris accord, he told EURACTIV in an interview, setting out the agenda for clean energy battles in the years ahead.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The Danish leader also upped the ante on the number of electric cars that will be on the road by 2030, saying there could be one million electric and hybrid cars by then. Rasmussen admitted it will “not be easy” to increase the number from a half-million suggested by climate council.</p>
<p>Denmark currently has just <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/452288/denmark-number-of-registered-passenger-cars/">over 2 million cars</a>, so it would represent half the private fleet, unless total numbers increase in the meantime.</p>
<p>Anders Stouge of energy company Dansk Energi reacted to Rasmussen’s announcement by tweeting that “the electricity sector is ready to support the phasing out of sales of petrol and diesel cars”, adding that the industry must supply the necessary infrastructure.</p>
<p>But electric car sales in Denmark are flagging after the government scrapped an incentive scheme at the start of 2017. In 2015, 4,762 plug-in sales were registered but that number plunged to 1,438 and then to 913 in the following years.</p>
<p>In 2017, EV sales represented just 0.4% of the market, while Sweden and Norway registered 5.3% and 39%.</p>
<p>It was actually Rasmussen’s government that decided to end a vehicle registration fee exemption for electric cars, instead plumping for a scheme that would eventually bring it to parity with traditional vehicles by 2022.</p>
<p>Now it seems likely that the Danish PM will have to address tax incentives in order to bring the market in line with his ambitious plans. As Denmark has no domestic car industry, it imposes import taxes that have in the past reached as high as 180%.</p>
<p>Next week, the government will go into specifics and reveal its climate plan, detailing how Denmark will cut emissions from various sectors like transport and agriculture. The government hopes to make the electricity sector 100% fossil fuel free by 2050.</p>

            <div><p class="_92842 quartz">In June, one of Waymo’s self-driving Chrysler Pacifica minivans crashed on the freeway outside of the company’s office in Mountain View, California, after its lone safety driver fell asleep at the wheel.</p><p class="_92842 quartz">Tech news site The Information, which <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/waymo-collision-shows-flaws-in-self-driving-car-tests?shared=82d7c8e62c2bdd94">first reported the crash</a> (paywall), said the human driver manning the vehicle “appeared to doze off” after about an hour on the road, according to two people familiar with the matter. The safety driver unwittingly turned off the car’s self-driving software by touching the gas pedal. He failed to assume control of the steering wheel, and the Pacifica crashed into the highway median.</p><p class="_92842 quartz">The dozing driver didn’t respond to any of the vehicle’s warnings, including a bell signaling the car was in manual mode and another audio alert, the Information reported. He regained alertness once the car crashed, then turned around and headed back to the Mountain View office. He no longer works for Waymo.</p><p class="_92842 quartz">Waymo got lucky with the accident. The safety driver wasn’t hurt and no other vehicles were involved. Waymo reported the vehicle sustained “moderate damage to its tire and bumper.” The company told The Information in a statement that it is “constantly improving our best practices, including those for driver attentiveness, because the safe and responsible testing of our technology is integral to everything we do.”</p><p class="_92842 quartz">Improvements in this case meant altering night-shift protocol to have two safety drivers instead of one, to guard against someone nodding off at the wheel. At a company meeting to discuss the incident, one attendee reportedly asked whether safety drivers were on the road too long, and was told that drivers can take a break whenever they need to.</p><p class="_92842 quartz">Waymo is pursuing fully self-driving software that wouldn’t require any intervention from humans, in contrast to automakers like Tesla and General Motors, which have started with selectively automated features to assist human drivers. As Waymo has gotten closer to true autonomy, it has also tried to reduce its reliance on human safety drivers by, for example, cutting the number of safety drivers in a test vehicle to one from two. Waymo plans to launch a <a href="https://qz.com/1208897/alphabets-waymo-googl-is-readying-a-ride-hailing-service-in-arizona-that-could-directly-compete-with-uber/">commercial ride-hail service with driverless cars</a> in the Phoenix area this year.</p><p class="_92842 quartz">After a self-driving Uber struck and killed a pedestrian in Tempe, Arizona in March, one point of focus was Uber’s safety-driver policies. <a href="https://jalopnik.com/just-about-everyone-uses-two-safety-drivers-when-testin-1823984330">Jalopnik pointed out</a> that “almost everyone”—Toyota, Nissan, Ford’s Argo AI—uses two people to test self-driving cars. In the Uber Volvo that crashed, on the other hand, Rafaela Vasquez was a lone safety driver, at night. She was later found by police to be <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-uber-selfdriving-crash/uber-cars-safety-driver-streamed-tv-show-before-fatal-crash-police-idUSKBN1JI0LB">streaming <em>The Voice</em> on her phone</a> at the time of impact.</p><p class="_92842 quartz">One thing everyone working on driverless cars agrees on is that humans are bad drivers. People from Waymo CEO John Krafcik to disgraced former Uber engineer Anthony Levandowski—try finding a more diametrically opposed pair—like to talk about how driverless cars will save lives by eliminating thousands of <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/autonomous-driving/faster-rollout-self-driving-cars-would-save-lives/">preventable highway fatalities</a> a year.</p><p class="_92842 quartz">It is baffling, then, that these companies trust the very humans they seek to unseat to watch over their adolescent technology, alone and for hours on end. An autonomous safety driver once described to me working 10- to 11-hour shifts unaccompanied, including nights that began in the early evening and ended well past midnight. Drivers could take breaks whenever they wanted, this person said, but it was still a challenge to stay focused for that long without anyone to talk to, or much to do beyond watching the road.</p><p class="_92842 quartz">A few months after the Tempe accident, Uber laid off <a href="https://qz.com/1326155/uber-has-terminated-its-self-driving-car-operators-in-pittsburgh/">most of its self-driving car operators</a> in Pittsburgh and San Francisco. Uber said it would replace these people with “mission specialists” trained to monitor its cars on roads and on specialized test tracks. These mission specialists are supposed to be more involved in the actual development of the cars, tasked with tracking, documenting, and triaging any issues that might crop up. Per a <a href="https://www.uber.com/careers/list/34593/?iis=uber.com/careers&amp;iisp=he-6594079">current job listing</a>, they should have “the ability to operate independently with little or no supervision.”</p><p class="_92842 quartz">There is a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/11/crash-how-computers-are-setting-us-up-disaster">great essay by reporter Tim Harford</a> about how our quest to automate all things may be setting us up for disaster. The more we let computers fly planes, drive cars, operate machinery, and so on, the less time the people we’ve put in place for backup—pilots, safety drivers, and other operators—are able to practice their skills, and the greater the odds they’ll be unprepared in a true emergency. This problem is known as the paradox of automation, and it applies to benign problems as well, like how we struggle to remember phone numbers that are stored in our mobile devices, or to do mental math that we can punch into a calculator. Like any skill, these need to be practiced to be maintained, and become rusty with disuse. Instead of designing technology for humans to babysit, Harford wonders, why aren’t we making technology that babysits humans?</p><hr /><p class="_92842 quartz"><em>A version of this post was originally published in Oversharing, a newsletter about the sharing economy. <a href="https://oversharing.substack.com/">Sign up for it here</a>.</em></p></div>

<p><strong>New generational approach enables users to easily differentiate between Wi-Fi<sup>® </sup>technologies</strong></p>
<p><strong>Austin, TX, - October 3, 2018 –</strong> Wi-Fi Alliance<sup>®</sup> introduces <strong>Wi-Fi 6</strong> as the industry designation for products and networks that support the next generation of Wi-Fi<sup>®</sup>, based on 802.11ax technology. <a href="https://www.wi-fi.org/wi-fi-6">Wi-Fi 6</a> is part of a new naming approach by Wi-Fi Alliance that provides users with an easy-to-understand designation for both the Wi-Fi technology supported by their device and used in a connection the device makes with a Wi-Fi network.</p>
<p>The new naming system identifies Wi-Fi generations by a numerical sequence which correspond to major advancements in Wi-Fi. The generation names can be used by product vendors to identify the latest Wi-Fi technology a device supports, by OS vendors to identify the generation of Wi-Fi connection between a device and network, and by service providers to identify the capabilities of a Wi-Fi network to their customers. The generational terminology may also be used to designate previous Wi-Fi generations, such as 802.11n or 802.11ac. The numerical sequence includes:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Wi-Fi 6</strong> to identify devices that support 802.11ax technology</li>
<li><strong>Wi-Fi 5</strong> to identify devices that support 802.11ac technology</li>
<li><strong>Wi-Fi 4</strong> to identify devices that support 802.11n technology</li>
</ul><p>Each generation of Wi-Fi offers new features – faster speeds, increased throughput, and better experiences. Industry adoption of the new terminology will help users better understand the experience they can expect. <strong>Wi-Fi 6</strong> will deliver an improved experience to address device and application needs in a range of consumer and enterprise environments. The generational terminology is expected to be widely adopted by the Wi-Fi ecosystem.</p>
<p>“For nearly two decades, Wi-Fi users have had to sort through technical naming conventions to determine if their devices support the latest Wi-Fi,” said Edgar Figueroa, president and CEO of Wi-Fi Alliance. “Wi-Fi Alliance is excited to introduce Wi-Fi 6, and present a new naming scheme to help industry and Wi-Fi users easily understand the Wi-Fi generation supported by their device or connection.”</p>
<p>In addition to describing the capabilities of the device, device manufacturers or OS vendors can incorporate the generational terminology in User Interface (UI) visuals to indicate the current type of Wi-Fi connection. The UI visual will adjust as a device moves between Wi-Fi networks so users have real-time awareness of their device connection. Beginning with <strong>Wi-Fi 6</strong>, Wi-Fi Alliance certification programs based on major IEEE 802.11 releases will use a generational Wi-Fi name; Wi-Fi CERTIFIED 6™ certification is coming in 2019.</p>

<p><strong><em>Industry support for Wi-Fi 6</em></strong></p>
<p><em>“Aerohive enthusiastically supports Wi-Fi Alliance’s new </em><em>consumer-friendly </em><em>Wi-Fi 6</em><em> naming convention in support of the emergence of IEEE’s new 802.11ax technology. Wi-Fi Alliance is now providing consumers the same type of generational Wi-Fi naming conventions to match what cellular technology has done since the beginning. Wi-Fi technology has evolved and improved over the last 21 years – from only a few megabits to several Gigabit speeds – yet this information is currently not provided. With Wi-Fi 6, consumers can easily identify the level of Wi-Fi provided and demand superior services. Additionally, we look forward to Wi-Fi Alliance’s launch of their Wi-Fi CERTIFIED 6™ certification program next year, and will submit our latest generation of Aerohive devices for certification at the first opportunity.” – Perry Correll, product management director, <strong>Aerohive Networks</strong></em></p>
<p><em>“AirTies commends Wi-Fi Alliance for simplifying Wi-Fi naming conventions and making them more consumer friendly. We look forward to using the term Wi-Fi 6, instead of 802.11ax, and educating our customers about the next-generation of Wi-Fi services and capabilities." – Metin Taskin, CTO of <strong>AirTies </strong></em></p>
<p><em>“Wi-Fi has evolved significantly since Aruba was founded 16 years ago – from its initial role as a secondary network within the enterprise enabling mobility to the mission-critical role it plays today as the primary connectivity method for billions of devices, users, and things. We applaud this effort by Wi-Fi Alliance to simplify the terminology used to differentiate between the different generations of technologies as it will help users more quickly and easily discern the technology their particular device or network supports.” – Lissa Hollinger, Vice President of Portfolio Marketing for <strong>Aruba</strong>, a Hewlett Packard Enterprise company</em></p>
<p><em> “Wi-Fi has revolutionized nearly every aspect of the last two decades, fueling significant social and economic development. As we enter a new generation of connectivity, Wi-Fi isn’t resting on its laurels. We’re packing in new capabilities that deliver blazing fast speeds, high throughput, ultra-low latency, enhanced security and new features like target wake time for a seamless connected experience across a wide range of use cases. Boingo is proud to be part of this generational Wi-Fi launch and work alongside Wi-Fi Alliance to establish programs that further evolve the wireless ecosystem.” – Dr. Derek Peterson, chief technology officer, <strong>Boingo Wireless </strong></em></p>

				<p>Jigsaw, the division owned by <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/google">Google <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> parent Alphabet, has revealed Intra, a new app aimed at protecting users from state-sponsored censorship.</p>
<p>Intra is a new app that aims to prevent DNS manipulation attacks. Whenever you visit a website, the easy-to-remember web address is converted to a less-than-memorable IP address — often over an unsecured connection. That makes it easy for oppressive governments — like Turkey, which has <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-dns-service-has-been-intercepted-by-turkish-isps-1396267208">used this technique</a> before — to intercept web addresses requests and either kill them in their tracks to stop sites from loading, or redirect to a fake site.</p>
<p>By passing all your browsing queries and app traffic through an encrypted connection to a trusted Domain Name Server, Intra says it ensures you can use your app without meddling or get to the right site without interference.</p>
<p>“Intra is dead simple to use. Just download the app and turn it on,” Jigsaw said. “That’s it.”</p>
<p>Jigsaw has already seen some successes in parts of the world where internet access is restricted or monitored. The government in Venezuela <a href="https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-net/2017/venezuela">reportedly used DNS manipulation</a> to prevent citizens from accessing news sites and social networks.</p>
<p><img class="breakout alignnone wp-image-1725278 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/intra-google.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="654" /></p>
<p>The app uses Google’s own trusted DNS server by default, but users can also funnel their browsing requests through <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/cloudflare">Cloudflare, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> which also hosts its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/01/cloudflares-new-privacy-focused-dns-service-speeds-up-your-web-browsing/">own publicly accessible secure DNS server</a>, or any other secure DNS server.</p>
<p>Admittedly, that requires a bit of trust for Google and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/cloudflare">Cloudflare <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> — or any third party. A Jigsaw spokesperson told TechCrunch that Intra’s use of Google’s DNS is covered by <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">its privacy policy</a>, and Cloudflare also <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/">has its own</a>.</p>
<p>Jigsaw said it will bake the app into <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/android">Android <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Pie, which already allows encrypted DNS connections. But Jigsaw is also making the app available for users in parts of the world with weaker economies that make upgrading from older devices near-impossible so they can benefit from the security features.</p>
<p>It’s the latest piece in the security and privacy puzzle that Jigsaw is trying to solve.</p>
<p>The little-known <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/alphabet">Alphabet <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> division is focused on preventing censorship, threats of online harassment and countering violent extremism. The incubator focuses on empowering free speech and expression by providing tools and services that make online safer for higher-risk targets.</p>
<p>Jigsaw has also invested its time on several other anti-censorship apps, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/25/the-mirai-botnets-internet-takedown-opens-up-a-new-market-for-attackers-and-defenders/">including Project Shield</a>, which protects sites against distributed denial-of-service attacks, as well as Outline, which gives reporters and activists a virtual private network that funnels data through a secure channel.</p>
